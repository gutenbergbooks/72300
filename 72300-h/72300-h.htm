<p>“I suppose I must write, and say she may
come. Personally, I shall be delighted to
have her; but I’m afraid Granby will think
a girl in the house rather a bore. Three <i>is</i>
such an awkward number in India!”</p>

<p>“And sometimes in other places,” added
a lady who sat on the fender-stool, blowing
a great wood fire, with a preposterously
small pair of bellows.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean, Milly,” retorted
her companion, a handsome, indolent-looking
woman, who reclined in an easy-chair,
with an open letter in her lap. “Houses
out here are only built for two, as a rule—especially
in cantonments. A victoria or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
pony-cart holds but two, and two is a
much more manageable number for dinners
and tiffins. Still, I shall be glad to have a
girl to chaperon; it will give me an object
in life, and more interest in going out.”</p>

<p>“Could you take more?” asked the lady
with the bellows, casting a sly smile over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>“To be sure I could, you disagreeable
little creature! When a woman is no
longer quite young, and her days of romance
are at an end, the hopes and prospects
of a pretty companion give her another
chance in the matrimonial lucky-bag—a
chance at second-hand, but still sufficiently
exciting. Alas! life after a certain age is
like a bottle of flat soda-water.”</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” rejoined the lady
with the bellows, stoutly.</p>

<p>“No; I should be surprised if you did.
You are so sympathetic and energetic.
You throw yourself heart and soul into
Dorcas meetings, bazaars, nurse-tending,
and other people’s joys or afflictions. Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
my sympathies and energies rarely extend
beyond Granby and myself. I am becoming
torpid. I can scarcely get up the steam for
a ball; even the prospect of cutting out old
Mother Brande fails to rouse me. However,
when I have a charming niece to
marry—and to marry well—things will
assume a different aspect. How amusing
it will be to eclipse the other girls and
their scheming mothers; how gratifying to
see all the best <i>partis</i> in the place grovelling
at her feet! Her triumphs will be mine.”
And Mrs. Langrishe slowly closed her
heavy eyelids, and appeared—judging from
her expression—to be wrapped in some
beatific vision. From this delicious contemplation
she was abruptly recalled by
the prosaic question—</p>

<p>“How old is she?”</p>

<p>“Let me see—dear, dear me! Yes,”
sitting erect and opening her fine eyes to
their widest extent, “why, strictly between
ourselves, she must be twenty-six. How
time flies! She is my eldest brother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
daughter, one of a large family. Fanny,
my sister in Calcutta, had her out eighteen
months ago, and now she is obliged to go
home, and wants to hand Lalla over to me.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” assented her listener,
with a sagacious nod.</p>

<p>“Can you also understand, that, simply
because Fanny and I have no children of
our own, our people seem to expect us to
provide for their olive-branches? I don’t
quite see it myself, though I do send them
my old dresses. Now let me read you my
letter,” unfolding it as she spoke.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“450, Chowringhee, Feb. 22nd.<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dearest Ida</span>,</p>

<p>“The doctors here say that
Richard must positively go home at once.
He has been out too long, and it is quite
time that another member of the firm took
a turn in the East. He has been working
hard, and it is essential for him to have a
complete holiday; and I must accompany
him—a step for which I was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
unprepared. I have taken a house at Simla
for the season—that I can easily relet and
get off my hands; but what am I to do
with dear little Lalla?</p>

<p>“The poor child only came out last cold
weather year, and cannot endure the idea
of leaving India—and no wonder, with any
number of admirers, and a box of new
dresses just landed by the mail steamer!
I had intended giving her such a gay
season, and sending Dick home alone; but
now all my nice little schemes have been
knocked on the head—how soon a few days,
even a few hours, out here alters all one’s
plans! And now to come to the gist of my
letter—will you take Lalla? I would not
trust her with any one but her own aunt,
though I know that Mrs. Monty-Kute is
dying to have her. You will find her a
most amusing companion; no one could be
dull with Lalla in the house. She is a
pretty girl, and will do you credit, and is
certain to be the belle of the place. She
has rather a nice little voice, plays the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
banjo and guitar, and dances like a professional.
As to her disposition, nothing in
this world is capable of ruffling her serene
temper—I cannot think who she takes
after, for it is not a <i>family</i> trait—I have
never once seen her put out, and that is
more than can be said for a girl in a thousand.
In fact, she <i>is</i> a girl in a thousand.
I can send her to you with a lovely outfit,
a new habit and saddle, and her pony, if
you wish. I am sure, dear, you will receive
her if you can possibly manage it;
and do your best to get her well <i>settled</i>, for
you know poor Eustace has Charlotte and
Sophy now quite grown up; even May is
eighteen. You are so clever, so popular,
so full of sense, dearest Ida—so superior
to my stupid self—that if you do consent
to take Lalla under your wing, her fortune
is practically made. We have engaged
passages in the <i>Paramatta</i>, which sails on
the twelfth, so write by return of post to</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">“Your loving sister,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Fanny Crauford</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“Fanny is quite right,” said Mrs. Langrishe,
with a slight tinge of contempt in
her tone. “She is by no means clever—just
an impulsive, good-natured goose, without
a scrap of tact, and is taken in and
imposed on on all sides. I won’t have the
pony, that is positive, and gram ten seers
for the rupee.”</p>

<p>“Then you have quite decided to take
the young lady?” exclaimed her companion
incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes;” now leaning back and clasping
two long white hands behind her head.
“Pretty, amusing, accomplished, good-tempered—I
don’t see <i>how</i> I can possibly
say no this time, though hitherto I have
steadily set my face against having out one
of my nieces. I have always said it was
so dreadfully unfair to Granby. However,
this niece is actually stranded in the
country, and it would look so odd if I
declined; besides, I shall like to have her;
we shall mutually benefit one another. She
will amuse me—rejuvenate me; be useful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
in the house—arrange flowers, write notes,
read to me, dust the ornaments, make
coffee and salad, and do all sorts of little
odd jobs, and ultimately cover me with
glory by making the match of the season!”</p>

<p>“And on your part—what is to be your
<i>rôle</i>?”</p>

<p>“I will give her a charming home;
I will have all the best men here, and
I will take her everywhere; give her, if
necessary, a couple of smart new ball-dresses,
and that too delicious opera-mantle
that has grown too small for me.”</p>

<p>“Or you too large for it—which?” inquired
Mrs. Sladen, with a slight elevation
of her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Milly, how odious you can be!”</p>

<p>“And about Major Langrishe?” continued
Milly, unabashed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Granby will be all right; but I must
write to Fanny by this post, and say that I
shall be delighted to have Lalla. Pour out
the tea like a good little creature, whilst I
scribble a line; the dâk goes down at six.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>The other lady, who had kindled the fire
and was now making tea, was not, as might
be supposed, the mistress of the house, but
merely an old friend who had dropped in
for a chat this cold March afternoon. She
was a slight, delicate-looking woman, with
dark hair, dark eyes, and numerous lines on
her thin, careworn face, though she was
barely thirty. No one ever dreamt of
calling Mrs. Sladen pretty, but most women
voted her “a darling,” and all men “a
little brick.” Married in her teens, before
she knew her own mind (but when her
relations had thoroughly made up theirs),
to an elderly eligible, she had become, from
the hour she left the altar, the slave of a
selfish, irascible husband, whose mental
horizon was bordered by two tables—the
dinner-table and the card-table—and whose
affections were entirely centred in his own
portly person. Milly Fraser’s people were
on the eve of quitting India; they were
poor; they had a large and expensive
family at home; otherwise they might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
have hesitated before giving their pretty
Milly (she <i>was</i> pretty in those days) to a
man more than double her age, notwithstanding
that he was drawing good pay,
and his widow would enjoy a pension.
They would have discovered—had they
made inquiries—that he was heavily in
debt to the banks; that he could not keep
a friend or a servant; and that, after all,
poor young Hastings, of the staff-corps,
whom they had so ruthlessly snubbed,
would have made a more satisfactory son-in-law.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sladen had two little girls in England,
whom her heart yearned over—little
girls being brought up among strangers
at a cheap suburban school. How often
had her husband solemnly promised that
“next year she should go home and see
the children;” but, when the time came,
he invariably hardened his heart, like
Pharaoh, King of Egypt, and would not let
her go. If she went, who was to manage
the house and servants, and see after his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
dinner and his comforts? <i>He</i> was not
going to be left in the hands of a khansamah!
And, moreover, where was the
money for her passage to come from? He
had not a rupee to spare (for her).</p>

<p>Colonel Sladen was a shrewd man when
his own interests were concerned. He was
alive to the fact that he was not popular,
but that things were made pleasant to him
all round for the sake of the unfortunate
lady whom he harried, and bullied, and
drove with a tongue like the lash of a
slaver’s whip. Yes; if she went home, it
would make a vast difference in his comfort,
socially and physically. Many a rude
rebuff she had saved him; many a kindness
was done to him for her sake; and many a
woman fervently thanked her good genius
that she was not his wife. In spite of her
uncongenial partner, Mrs. Sladen managed
to be cheerful, and generally bright and
smiling, ready to nurse the sick, to decorate
the club for dances, to help girls to compose
ball-dresses, to open her heart to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
their troubles, and to give them sympathy
and sound advice. “Oh, do not marry a
man simply because your people wish it,”
she might have said (but she never did),
“and merely because he is considered a
good match; far better to go home and
earn your bread as a shop-assistant, or even
a slavey. Take a lesson from <i>my</i> fate.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe, on the other hand, ruled
her dear Granby with a firm but gracious
sway. <i>Their</i> match had been made in
England, and had proved in one respect a
severe and mutual disappointment. Well,
“disappointment” is an ugly word; shall
we say “surprise”? Captain Langrishe
had been attracted by Ida Paske’s handsome
face, stately deportment, and magnificent
toilettes. He was impressed by
her superb indifference to money—rumour
endowed her with a large income, and
rumour had no real grounds for this agreeable
assertion. Ida was one of a numerous
family, was good-looking, self-reliant, ambitious,
and eight and twenty. Her dresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
were unpaid for, and her face was her
fortune. She, on her part, believed the
insignificant-looking little officer—whose
pale profile looked exactly as if it were cut
out of a deal board—to be enormously rich.
He, too, affected to despise outlay, and
kept hunters, and talked of his yacht. He
was going to India, immediately, and the
wedding was hurried on; but long ere the
happy pair had reached Bombay, they had
discovered the real state of affairs. He
knew that his bride was penniless; and she
was aware that the hunters had been hired,
the yacht had been a loan, and that three
hundred a year, besides his pay, was the
utmost limit of her husband’s purse. They
were a wise couple, and made the best of
circumstances; and by-and-by Captain
Langrishe came to the conclusion that he
had got hold of a treasure, after all! His
Ida was full of tact and worldly wisdom,
and possessed administrative powers of the
highest order. She understood the art of
keeping up appearances, and laid to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
heart that scriptural text which says, “As
long as thou doest well unto thyself, men
will speak well of thee.” She ensured her
husband a comfortable home, studied his
tastes, flattered his weaknesses, was always
serene, affectionate, and well-dressed. Her
dinners were small but celebrated; her
entrées and savouries, a secret between her
cook and herself. She did not dispense
indiscriminate hospitalities—no, she merely
entertained a few important officials, smart
women, and popular men, who would be
disposed to noise abroad the fame of her
dainty feasts, and to pay her back again
with interest. Shabby people, and insignificant
acquaintances, never saw the interior
of her abode, which was the embodiment
of comfort and taste. Her dresses
were well chosen and costly; diamonds
sparkled on her fingers and on her neck;
and though but till recently a captain’s
wife, her air and manner of calm self-approval
was such, that the wives of higher
officials meekly accepted her at her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
valuation, and frequently suffered her to
thrust them into the background and usurp
their place. Such was her ability, that
people took the cue from her, and valued
an invitation to afternoon tea with Mrs.
Langrishe far above an elaborate dinner
with less exclusive hostesses.</p>

<p>Neither the furious attacks of her enemies
(and she had not a few), nor the
occasional indiscretions of her friends, ever
ruffled the even temperament of this would-be
“grande dame.” It was an astonishing
but patent fact that she invariably occupied,
so to speak, a chief seat; that she
was always heralded on her arrival at a
station—met, entertained, and regretfully
sped. Whilst ladies as worthy languished
in the dâk bungalow, and drove in rickety
ticca gharries, she had the carriages of
rajahs at her disposal, and was overwhelmed
with attentions and invitations. Surely all
this was amply sufficient to make these
women “talk her over” and hold her at
arms’ length. Men who knew Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Langrishe’s resources marvelled amongst
themselves, and said, “Gran has very little
besides his pay; how the deuce does he do
it? Look at his wife’s dresses! And they
give the best dinners in the place. There
will be a fine smash there some day!” But
years rolled on, and there was no sign of
any such crisis. The truth was that Granby
Langrishe had married an exceedingly able
woman—a woman who thoroughly understood
the art of genteel pushing and personal
advertisement. She had persistently
edged—yea, driven her husband to the
front, and he now enjoyed an excellent
appointment at the price of the two dewy
tears that stood in his Ida’s expressive eyes
when bemoaning his bad luck to an influential
personage. The Langrishes were
drawing two thousand rupees a month,—and
were held in corresponding esteem.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe does not look forty—far
from it. She has taken excellent care of
herself—no early rising, no midday visiting,
for this wise matron. She is tall, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
fine figure, alas! getting somewhat stout;
her brows are straight and pencilled;
beneath them shine a pair of effective grey
eyes; her features are delicately cut; if
her face has a fault, it is that her jaw is a
<i>little</i> too square. Whatever people may
say of Ida Langrishe, they cannot deny
that she is remarkably handsome, and as
clever as she is handsome. As a spinster,
she had not been entirely successful in her
own aims; but it would go hard, if, with
her brains, her circle of acquaintances, and
her valuable experience, she did not marry
her niece brilliantly.</p>

</div>


<p>The French windows of Mrs. Langrishe’s
drawing-room opened into a deep stone
verandah embowered in honeysuckle and
passion flowers, and commanded a matchless
view, irrespective of the foreground, in
which Mrs. Sladen’s rickshaw is the chief
feature, or the gravel sweep, grass garden,
and beds of pale wintry roses; but beyond
the pineclad hills, among which red roofs
are peeping, beyond the valley of rhododendrons,
and a bold purple range, behold the
snows! a long, long barrier of the everlasting
hills, to such as the eyes of the
psalmist had never been lifted. People
may whisper that they were disappointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
in the Taj, that Delhi was a delusion, and
the marble rocks a snare; but who can
declare that the snows were beneath his
expectations? And if he were to say so,
who would be found to believe him? The
evening breeze is raw and chill, it has
travelled sixty miles from those icy slopes,
it creeps up the khud, and warns the
shivering roses that the sun has set—it
stirs the solemn deodars as they stand in
dark outline against the sky.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe, rising from her writing-table,
letter in hand, sweeps back to her
friend, who is again sitting on the fender-stool,
staring into the fire, thinking, perchance,
of those bygone days when <i>she</i> was
a girl whose friends were anxious to get
her settled.</p>

<p>“Milly,” said her hostess, “you are
passing the post-office, and you can post
this for me; you had better go now, dear,
as you know you have had a sore throat,
and it is getting late.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sladen rose at once; she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
accustomed to being sent on errands and to
being made use of by her intimates. She
pulled on her cheap gloves, twisted her
stringy boa round her neck, and held out
her hand for the letter that was to bring
Miss Paske to Shirani. As her friend
stooped and kissed her, she looked up at
her wistfully, and said—</p>

<p>“Ida, if this girl comes to you, you won’t
think of her only as a marketable article,
will you? You will allow her to marry—if
she does marry—to please herself, won’t
you, dear?”</p>

<p>“You silly, romantic little person!”
exclaimed the other, patting her cheek
with two solid taper fingers. “What an
absurd question. As if any girl is ever
married against her will in these enlightened
days!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sladen made no answer beyond an
involuntary sigh. She went out to the
verandah, and got into her rickshaw without
another word and ere she was whirled
away, nodded a somewhat melancholy farewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
to her handsome, prosperous-looking
friend who, clad in a rich tea-gown, had
framed herself for a moment in the open
doorway, and called out imperiously—</p>

<p>“The post goes at six; you have just
ten minutes.” Then, with a shiver, Mrs.
Langrishe closed the window and returned
to her comfortable fireside. “Poor Milly!”
she muttered, as she warmed one well-shod
foot. “She was always odd and sentimental.
Marry to please herself—yes, by
all means—but she must also marry to
please <i>me</i>!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A rickshaw (the popular conveyance in
the Himalayan hill-stations) is a kind of
glorified bath-chair or grown-up perambulator,
light and smart, and drawn and
pushed by four men; it flies along flat roads
and down hills as rapidly as a pony-cart,
especially if your Jampannis are racing
another team.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sladen’s rickshaw was old; the
hood, of cheap American leather, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
cracked and blistered, it had a list to one
side, and her Jampannis wore the shabby
clothes of last year—but, then, their mistress
did the same! As they dashed down hill,
they nearly came into collision with a smart
Dyke’s cee-spring vehicle, and a quartette
of men in brilliant (Rickett’s) blue and
yellow liveries. The rickshaw contained
an elderly lady of ample proportions, with
flaxen hair and a good-humoured handsome
face surmounting two chins. This was Mrs.
Brande, the wife of Pelham Brande, Esq.,
a distinguished member of the Civil
Service.</p>

<p>“Kubbardar, kubbardar!—take care,
take care!” she shrieked. Then to Mrs.
Sladen, “My gracious! how you do fly!
but you are a light weight. Well, come
alongside of me, my dear, and tell me all
the news; this place is as dull as ditch-water,
so few people here. Next year, I
shan’t come up so early.”</p>

<p>“I believe every house is taken,” said
Mrs. Sladen, cheerfully, as they rolled along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
side by side. “Even the Cedars, and the
Monastery, and Haddon Hall.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! The chimneys smoke
beyond anything. I pity whoever is going
there.”</p>

<p>“A bachelor, I believe, a Captain Waring,
has taken it for the season, as it’s close to
the mess.”</p>

<p>“In the regiment that’s marching up—the
Scorpions?”</p>

<p>“No; I believe he is out of the service,
and coming up for the hot weather, and to
try and get some shooting in Thibet later
on.”</p>

<p>“Then he must have money?” wagging
her head sagaciously.</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say he has. I’m told it is
going to be a gay season.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they always say,” replied
Mrs. Brande, impatiently. “I’ll believe it
when I see it. But I did hear that Mrs.
Kane is expecting a brother that is a
baronet: he’s coming up to see the hills;
he has been globe-trotting all winter. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
so you have been up with the Duchess—she’s
all alone, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for the present; but she will soon
have a niece with her—a niece from
Calcutta.”</p>

<p>“A niece!” sharply, and leaning half
out of the rickshaw. “What niece?”</p>

<p>“Her brother’s daughter, Miss Paske;
she is said to be very pretty and accomplished,
and attractive in every way.”</p>

<p>“You need not tell me <i>that</i>!” in accents
of concentrated contempt. “Is Mrs. Langrishe
the woman to saddle herself with an
ugly girl? She’ll be having grand parties
now; all the rich young fellows, and the
<i>baronet</i>—no poor subalterns, you’ll see—and
she will get her off her hands in no
time. Just the sort of thing she will like,
and a fine excuse for having packs of men
dangling about the house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Brande, you know that is not
her style,” expostulated her companion.</p>

<p>“Well, well, she is your friend—a school-fellow,
too—though <i>you</i> must have been in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the infant-school, so I’ll say no more—but
you know I am not double-faced, and I
cannot abide her, and her airs, and her
schemes, and her always pushing herself
to the front, and sitting in the general’s
pew, and being the first to ask that Austrian
prince to dinner, and getting up at parties
and sailing out before the commissioner’s
wife—such impudence!—and people put
up with her. If poor little Mrs. Jones was
to do such things—and she has a better
right, being an honourable’s daughter—I’d
like to know what would be said? But
there’s no fear of Mrs. Jones; there’s no
brass about <i>her</i>,” and Mrs. Brande gave
a bounce, that made the cee-springs
quiver!</p>

<p>“Now, Mrs. Brande, you forget that Ida
is my friend.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and better be her friend than her
enemy! Well, here is my turn, and here
we part”; and, with a valedictory wave of
her podgy hand, in another instant Mrs.
Brande was thundering down the narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
road that led to the best house in Sharani—her
own comfortable, hospitable dwelling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sladen posted her letter, and went
on to the club and reading-room, a long,
low building overlooking a series of terraces
and tennis-courts, and the chief resort of
the whole station. As she entered the gate,
she encountered an elderly gentleman, with
beetling brows, a coarse grey moustache,
and a portly figure, riding a stout black
pony.</p>

<p>“Been looking for you everywhere,” he
bellowed; “where the mischief have you
been? Swilling tea as usual, I suppose?
Soper and Rhodes are coming to take ‘pot
luck,’ so go home at once—and, I say, I
hear there is fish at Manockjees’, just come
up; call in on your way, and fetch it in
the rickshaw.”</p>

<p>Exit Colonel Sladen to his evening
rubber; exit Mrs. Sladen to carry home
much-travelled fish, and possibly to cook
the chief portion of the dinner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br><span class="small">“OTHER PEOPLE HAS NIECES TOO.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Sladen had not only given Mrs.
Brande a piece of news; she had introduced
her to a grand idea—an idea
that took root and grew and flourished in
that lady’s somewhat empty mind, as she
sat alone in her drawing-room over a
pleasant wood-fire, which she shared impartially
with a sleek, self-conscious fox-terrier.</p>

<p>All the world admitted that once upon
a time “old Mother Brande” must have
been a beautiful woman. Even now her
fair skin, blue eyes, and chiselled features
entitled her to rank as a highly respectable
wreck. Who would have thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
refined, fastidious, cynical Pelham Brande
would have married the niece of a lodging-house
keeper? Perhaps if he had anticipated
the career which lay before him—how
unexpectedly and supremely successful
he was to be, how the fierce light inseparable
from high places was to beat upon
his fair-haired Sarabella—he might have
hesitated ere he took such a rash and
romantic step. Little did he suppose that
his fair-haired Sally, who had waited so
capably on him, would one day herself be
served by gorgeous scarlet-clad Government
chupprassis; or that she was bound to
walk out of a room before the wives of
generals and judges, and that she would
have a “position” to maintain! But who
is as wise at two and twenty as he is at
fifty-two? At two and twenty Pelham
Brande had just passed for the India Civil
Service, and was lodging in London; and
whilst preparing for the Bar he got typhoid
fever, and very nearly died. He was carefully
tended by Mrs. Batt, his landlady,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and her lovely niece Sarabella, who was
as fair as a June rose, and as innocent as
a March lamb.</p>

<p>The best medical authorities assure us,
that nothing is so conducive to convalescence
as a skilful and pretty nurse, and
under the influence of Sara’s ministrations
Mr. Brande made rapid progress towards
recovery, but fell a victim to another
malady—which proved incurable. He did
not ask his relations for permission or
advice, but married his bride one morning
at St. Clement Danes, took a week’s trip
to Dover, and two first-class passages to
Bombay.</p>

<p>As a rule, junior civilians are despatched
without ruth to lonely jungle districts,
where they never see another white face for
weeks, and their only associates are their
native subordinates, their staffs of domestics,
and the simple dwellers in the neighbouring
villages. Now and then they may chance
on an opium official, or a forest officer,
and exchange cheroots, and newspapers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
but these meetings are rare. After a
busy university career, after an immense
strain on the mental faculties, necessary to
passing a severe examination, the dead
sameness of that life, the silence and loneliness
of the jungle (aggravated by the artless
prattle of the office baboo), is enough
to unhinge the strongest mind. Miles and
miles from the haunts of his countrymen,
from books and telegrams, and the stir and
excitement of accustomed associations, the
plunge from the roar of the London streets,
and life at high pressure, to the life in a
solitary up-country district, is indeed a
desperate one; especially if the new-comer’s
eyes and ears are not open to the great
book of Nature—if he sees no beauty in
stately peepul-trees, tracts of waving grain,
venerable temples, and splendid sunsets; if
he does not care to beat for pig, or shoot
the thirsty snipe, but merely sits in his
tent door in the cool of the evening, his
labours o’er, and languishes for polo,
cards, and theatres. Then he may well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
curse his lot; he is undeniably in a bad
way.</p>

<p>Pelham Brande had nothing to fear from
loneliness or <i>ennui</i>. Sara made him an
excellent helpmate. She picked up the
language and customs with surprising
facility; she proved a capital housekeeper,
and as shamelessly hard at a bargain as
any old native hag. But she never took
to books, or to the letter “h.” For years
the Brandes lived in out-of-the-way districts,
and insignificant stations, until by
slow degrees his services and abilities conducted
him to the front. As advancing
time promoted him, his wife declined in
looks, and increased in bulk, and her tastes
and eccentricities became fixed. Pelham
was not actually ashamed of his partner,
but he was alive to the fact, that, with a
cultivated gentlewoman at the head of his
establishment, he would have occupied a
vastly more agreeable social position. But
he never admitted—what his friends loudly
affirmed—that, as he sat opposite to Sara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
day after day, he was also sitting face to
face with the one great mistake of his
life!</p>

<p>Twice he had taken her to Australia for
six months, but never (nor did she desire
it) to her native land. Once, years ago, he
ran home himself, and was received by his
relations, as relations generally welcome
a wealthy, childless, and successful man.
They even brought themselves to ask,
somewhat timidly, for Sara; and she, on
her part, sent them generous consignments
of curry powder, red pepper, and her own
special and far-famed brand of chutney.
The good lady had not many resources
beyond housekeeping. She read the daily
paper, and now and then a society novel,
if it was plentifully peopled with lords and
ladies; she could write an ordinary note,
invitation, or refusal, and a letter (with a
dictionary beside her). She was fond of
her cows, and poultry, and adored her dog
Ben; gave excellent, but desperately dull
dinners; dressed sumptuously in gorgeous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
colours; enjoyed a gossip; loved a game of
whist—and hated Mrs. Langrishe. She
lived a monotonous and harmless life,
vibrating between the hills and plains each
season, with clockwork regularity.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Brande sat before her fire, and
watched the crackling pinewood, she was
not happy. Officially she was the chief
lady of the place, the “Burra mem sahib;”
but clever Mrs. Langrishe was the real
leader of society, and bore away all the
honours—the kernel, so to speak, of distinction,
leaving her but the miserable
shell. With a young and pretty girl as
her companion, she would be more insufferable
and more sought after than ever. As
it was, she, Sara Brande, could make but
little stand against her; and once her
enemy was allied to a charming and popular
niece, she might figuratively lay down her
arms and die. She was a friendless, desolate
old woman. If her little Annie had
lived, it would have been different; and
she had no belongings, no nieces. No!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
but—happy thought!—Pelham had no less
than three, who were poor and, by all
accounts, pretty. He had helped their
mother, his sister, to educate them; he
sent them money now and then. Why
should she not adopt one of these girls,
and have a niece also? Yes, she would
write herself; she would speak to Pelham
that very evening after dinner (it was his
favourite dinner). The more she became
accustomed to the idea, as she turned it
over in her mind, the more she was filled
with delight, resolve, and anticipation. The
girl’s route, steamer, room, dresses, were
already chosen, and she was in the act of
selecting her future husband, when Mr.
Brande entered, brisk and hungry.</p>

<p>After dinner, when Mr. Brande was
smoking a cigarette, his artful wife opened
the subject next to her heart, and remarked,
as she handed him a cup of fragrant
coffee—</p>

<p>“Pelham, you are often away on tour,
are you not? and I feel uncommon lonely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
I can tell you. I am not as active or as
cheerful as I used to be. I’m too old for
dancing, and tennis, and riding. Not that
I ever was much hand at them.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you want to come on tour?
or shall I buy you a pony, or hire you a
companion?” inquired Mr. Brande facetiously—a
clean-shaven, grey-haired man,
with thin mobile lips, keen eyes, and, at a
little distance, a singularly boyish appearance.
“What would you like to do?”</p>

<p>“I should like to ride and dance by
proxy,” was the unexpected answer. “Let
us ask out one of those Gordon girls, your
nieces. I’d be very good to her; and you
know, Pel, I’m a lonely creature, and if
our own little Annie had lived, I would
not be wanting to borrow another woman’s
daughter to keep me company.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brande was surveying his wife with
a severely judicial expression; it relaxed as
she spoke of their only child, buried far
away, under a tamarind tree, on the borders
of Nepaul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Yes, their little Annie would have been
five and twenty had she lived, and doubtless
as lovely as Sally Batt, who had turned his
head, mitigated his success, and whom he
rarely repented of having married.</p>

<p>“Your sister has three girls,” she continued,
“and she is badly off. What is the
pension of a colonel’s widow? Why, less
than some folks give their cooks.”</p>

<p>“It is not considerable, certainly, and
Carrie finds it hard enough to make both
ends meet; she never was much of a
manager. But, Sally, a girl is a great
responsibility, and you are not accustomed
to young people.”</p>

<p>“No; but I can learn to study them,
for I’m fond of them. Say ‘Yes,’ Pel,
and I’ll write. We will pay her passage,
of course, and I’ll meet her myself at
Allahabad.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brande tossed the end of his cigarette
into the fire, fixed his eye-glass firmly in
his eye, and contemplated his wife in
silence. At last he said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“May I ask what has put this idea into
your head all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>“It’s not—exactly—sudden,” she stammered;
“I’ve often a sort of lonely feel.
But I must truthfully say that I never
thought of your niece till to-day, when I
heard that Mrs. Langrishe is getting up one
of hers from Calcutta.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brande jerked the glass hastily on
to his waistcoat, and gave a peculiarly long
whistle.</p>

<p>“I see! And you are not going to be
beaten by Mrs. Langrishe—you mean to
run an opposition girl, and try which will
have the best dresses, the most partners,
and be married first? No, no, Sally! I
utterly refuse to lend myself to such a
scheme, or to allow one of Carrie’s daughters
to enter for that sort of competition.” And
he crossed his legs, and took another
cigarette.</p>

<p>“But listen to me, Pel,” rising as she
spoke; “I declare to you that I won’t do
what you say, and, any way, <i>your</i> niece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
will be in quite a different position to the
Langrishe’s girl. I’ll be as good to her as
if she was my own—I will indeed!” and
her voice trembled with eagerness. “I’m
easy to get on with—look how long I
keep my servants,” she pleaded. “These
Gordons are your nearest kin; you ought
to do something for them. I suppose they
will come in for all your money. Your
sister is delicate, and if anything happened
to her you’d have to take, not one girl,
but the whole <i>three</i>. How would you like
that? Now, if one of them was nicely
married, she would make a home for her
sisters.”</p>

<p>“You are becoming quite an orator, and
there is something in what you say. Well,
I’ll think it over, and let you know to-morrow,
Sally. As to leaving them my
money, I’m only fifty-two, and I hope to
live to spend a good slice of it myself.”
And then Mr. Brande took up a literary
paper and affected to be absorbed in its
contents. But although he had the paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
before him, he was not reading; he was
holding counsel with himself.</p>

<p>He had not seen Carrie’s girls since they
counted their ages in double figures; they
were his nearest of kin, were very poor, and
led dull lives in an out-of-the-way part of
the world. Yes, he ought to do something,
and it would please the old lady to give her
a companion, and a pretty, fresh young face
about the house would not be disagreeable
to himself. But what would a refined and
well-educated English girl think of her
aunt, with her gaudy dresses, bad grammar,
mania for precedence, and brusque, unconventional
ways? Well, one thing was
certain, she would soon discover that she
had a generous hand and a kind heart.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Brande, having
duly slept on the project, gave his consent
and a cheque, and Mrs. Brande was so
dazzled with her scheme, and so dazed with
all she had to think of, that she added up
her bazaar account wrong, and gave the
cook a glass of vinegar in mistake for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
sherry—which same had a fatal effect on
an otherwise excellent pudding.</p>

<p>In order to compose her letter comfortably,
and without distraction, Mrs. Brande
shut herself up in her own room, with
writing materials and dictionary, and told
the bearer to admit no one, not even Mrs.
Sladen. After two rough copies and two
hours’ hard labour, the important epistle
was finished and addressed, and as Mrs.
Brande stamped it with a firm hand, she
said to herself aloud—</p>

<p>“I do trust Ben won’t be jealous. I
hope he will like her!”</p>

<p>Being mail day, Mrs. Brande took it to
the post herself, and as she turned from
dropping it into the box, she met her great
rival coming up the steps, escorted by two
men. Mrs. Langrishe was always charming
to her enemy, because it was bad style to
quarrel, and she knew that her pretty
phrases and pleasing smiles infuriated the
other lady to the last degree; and she said, as
she cordially offered a neatly gloved hand—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“How do you <i>do</i>? I have not seen you
for ages! I know it’s my business to call,
as I came up last; but, really I have so
many engagements, and such tribes of
visitors——”</p>

<p>“Oh, pray don’t apologize!” cried Mrs.
Brande, reddening; “I’d quite forgotten—I
really thought you had called!” (May
Sara Brande be forgiven for this terrible
falsehood.)</p>

<p>It was now Mrs. Langrishe’s turn to
administer a little nip.</p>

<p>“Of course you are going to dine at the
Maitland-Perrys’ next week?” (well knowing
that she had not been invited). “Every
one who is <i>anybody</i> is to be there. There
are not many up yet, it is so early; but it
will be uncommonly smart—as far as it
goes—and given for the baronet!”</p>

<p>“No, I am not going, I have not been
asked,” rejoined Mrs. Brande with a gulp.
She generally spoke the truth, however
much against the grain.</p>

<p>“Not asked! how very odd. Well,” with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
a soothing smile, “I dare say they will have
you at their <i>next</i>. I hear that we are to
expect quite a gay season.”</p>

<p>“And I was told that there will be no
men.”</p>

<p>“Really! That won’t affect you much,
as you don’t ride, or dance, or go to picnics;
but it is sad news for poor me, for I am
expecting a niece up from Calcutta, and I
hope the place will be lively.”</p>

<p>“But I <i>do</i> mind, Mrs. Langrishe, just as
much as you do,” retorted the other, with a
triumphant toss of her head. “Perhaps
you may not be aware that I am expecting
a niece, too?” (How could Mrs. Langrishe
possibly divine what the good lady herself
had only known within the last few hours?)
“Yours is from Calcutta, but mine is all
the way from England!” And her glance
inferred that the direct Europe importation
was a very superior class of consignment.
Then she added, “Other people has
nieces too, you see!” And with a magnificent
bow, she flounced down the steps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
bundled into her rickshaw, and was whirled
away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe stood watching the four
blue and yellow jampannis, swiftly vanishing
in a cloud of dust, with a smile of malicious
amusement.</p>

<p>“Other people has nieces too, you see!”
turning to her companions with admirable
mimicry. “She is not to be outdone.
What fun it is! Cannot you fancy what
she will be like—Mrs. Brande’s niece, all
the way from England? If not, I can
inform you. She will have hair the colour
of barley-sugar, clothes the colours of the
rainbow, and not an ‘h’!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br><span class="small">THE THREE YOUNG MAIDS OF HOYLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was true that Mrs. Gordon and her
daughters resided in a dull, out-of-the-way
part of the world; but they could not help
themselves. They lived at Hoyle, in the
first instance, because it was cheap; and,
in the second place, because living at Hoyle
had now become second nature to Mrs.
Gordon, and nothing short of a fire or an
earthquake could remove her.</p>

<p>Hoyle is in the south of England, within
a stone’s throw of a shingly beach, and
commands a full view of the white shores
of France. It is an old-fashioned hamlet,
at least fifty years behind the age, where
the curfew is still sounded, the sight of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
telegraph envelope is only interpreted as a
messenger of death, and is cut off from
the bustling outer world by the great expanse
of Romney Marsh. In deference to
this <i>fin de siècle</i> age, a single line of rail
crawls across the seaside desert, and once
or twice a day a sleepy train stops just one
mile short of the village. The village of
Hoyle was once a chartered town, and was
built many centuries before trains were invented.
It was even out of the track of the
lively stage-coaches, and owed its wealth
and rise—and fall—entirely to its convenient
proximity to the sea, its seclusion,
its charming view of the opposite coast.
Yes, its solid prosperity—low be it spoken—was
due to smuggling. The High Street
is lined by picturesque red-brick houses,
which are occupied by the descendants of—shall
we say sailors?—a well-to-do primitive,
most respectable community, though
from yonder upper window the present
tenant’s grandfather shot a preventive
officer stone dead; and in the chimney of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the next cottage (a most innocent-looking
abode) three men who were in trouble lay
concealed for a whole week. The capacious
cellars of the Cause is Altered inn, were,
within living memory, no strangers to bales
of silk and casks of brandy.</p>

<p>Between the village and the inn there
stands a solid old red house, with a small
enclosed garden in front, and a paved footpath
leading to its mean little green hall-door.
The windows are narrow, the rooms
irregular, and the ceilings absurdly low—but
so is the rent. It suits its tenants
admirably; it is warm, roomy, and cheap;
it boasts of a fine walled garden at the rear,
of acres of cellarage, and is known by the
name of Merry Meetings. This jovial
designation is not of modern date, but
points back to the grand old days when it
was the residence of the chief man in
Hoyle; when it was club, bank, receiving-house,
and fortress. Many were the
carousals that took place in Mrs. Gordon’s
decent panelled parlour. To what grim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
tales and strange oaths have its walls given
ear! There have been merry meetings, of
a much tamer description in the present
time, when the maidens of the neighbourhood
have gathered round the table, and
chatted and laughed over cups of honest
tea, brewed in Mrs. Gordon’s thin old
silver teapot. Pretty girls have discussed
dress, tennis, and weddings, where formerly
weather-beaten, bearded men assembled to
celebrate the safe arrival of a newly-run
cargo, and to appraise filmy laces, foreign
silks, and cigars, and to quaff prime cognac
and strange but potent waters.</p>

<p>The widow and her daughters have occupied
Merry Meetings for fifteen years, ever
since the death of Colonel Gordon. He
had retired from the service and settled
down near a garrison town, intending to
turn his sword into a ploughshare; but in
an evil moment he ventured his all in a
tempting speculation, hoping thereby to
double his income; but instead of which,
alas! water came into the Wheal Rebecca,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
and swept away every penny. Seeing
nothing between him and the poor-house
but a small pension, Colonel Gordon was
not brave enough to face the situation, and
died of a broken heart—though it was
called a rapid decline—leaving his widow
and three little girls to struggle with the
future as best they could.</p>

<p>Colonel Gordon’s connections were so
furious with him for losing his money, that
they sternly refused to assist his widow;
therefore she meekly collected the remains
of the domestic wreck, and retired to Hoyle
with her children and an old servant, who
had strongly recommended her native place,
where her “mistress could live in peace
and quiet until she had time to turn herself
round and make plans.” Mrs. Gordon
took Merry Meeting, which was partly
furnished, for three months, and had remained
there for fifteen years. Her plans
were still undeveloped; she constantly
talked of moving, but never got beyond
that point. Occasionally she would say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
“Well, girls, I really will give notice this
term. We must move; we must decide
something. I will write to a house agent.
And, Honor, you need not mind getting
the garden seeds, or having the kitchen
whitewashed.” But when to-morrow came
these plans had melted into air, and the
garden-seeds were set, and the kitchen
renovated, as usual.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon was something of an invalid,
and became more lethargic year by year,
and a prey to an incurable habit of procrastination.
She resigned her keys, purse,
and authority into the hands of her eldest
daughter, and contented herself with taking
a placid interest in the garden, the weather,
the daily paper, and sampling various new
patent medicines. She still retained the
remains of remarkable personal beauty and
a fascination of manner that charmed all
who came in contact with her, from the
butcher’s boy to the lord of the soil. People
said that it was shamefully unfair to her
girls, the way in which Mrs. Gordon buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
herself—and them—alive. She never made
the smallest effort to better their lot, but
contented herself with sitting all day in a
comfortable easy-chair, making gracious
remarks and looking handsome, stately, and
languid.</p>

<p>Life was monotonous at Merry Meetings.
Two or three tennis-parties in summer, two
or three carpet-dances in winter, now and
then a day’s shopping in Hastings, were
events which were varied by long gray
stretches of uneventful calm. The daily
paper was a most welcome arrival; and the
Miss Gordons entertained as eager an expectation
of letters, of stirring news, of
“something coming by the post,” of “something
happening,” as if they lived in the
midst of a large and busy community.</p>

<p>And what of the three Miss Gordons?</p>

<p>Jessie, the eldest, is twenty-six, and
quite surprisingly plain. She has pale eyes
and a dark complexion, instead of dark eyes
and a pale complexion, also a nose that
would scarcely be out of place in a burlesque.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
She is clever, strong-willed, and
practical, and manages the whole family
with admirable tact, including Susan, the
domestic treasure.</p>

<p>Jessie Gordon’s name is well known as
the author of pretty stories in girls’ and
children’s magazines. She earns upwards
of a hundred a year by her pen (which she
generally adds to the common purse), and
is regarded by her neighbours with a certain
amount of pride, slightly tempered with
uneasiness. Supposing she were to put
some of her friends into a book! However,
they criticize her work sharply to her face,
make a great virtue of purchasing the
magazines in which her tales appear, and
magnify her merits, fame, and earnings to
all outsiders.</p>

<p>Fairy, whose real name is Flora, comes
next to Jessie in age; she is about two and
twenty, and has a perfectly beautiful face—a
face to inspire poets and painters, faultless
in outline, and illumined by a pair
of pathetic blue eyes. A most delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
complexion—of which every care, reasonable
or unreasonable, is taken—and quantities of
fine sunny brown hair, combine to complete
a vision of loveliness. Yes, Fairy Gordon
is almost startlingly fair to see; and seen
seated at a garden-party or in a ball-room,
all the strange men present instantly
clamour for an introduction; and when it
has been effected, and the marvellously
pretty girl rises to dance, behold she is a
dwarf—a poor little creature, with a shrill,
harsh voice, and only four feet four inches
in height! Her figure is deceptive—the
body very long in proportion to the limbs.</p>

<p>Many and many a shock has Fairy administered
to a would-be partner. Did she
ever read their consternation in their faces?
Apparently never; for no matter who remained
at home, Fairy could not endure
to miss an entertainment, even a school
feast or a children’s party. It was an unwritten
family law that Fairy must always
come first, must always be shielded, petted,
indulged, amused, and no one subscribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
to this rule more readily than the second
Miss Gordon herself. She was keenly alive
to her own beauty, and talked frankly to
her intimates of her charms; but she never
once referred to her short stature, and her
sisters but rarely alluded to the fact between
themselves, and then with bated breath.
Even six inches would have made all the
difference in the world; but four feet four
was—well, remarkable. Of course the
neighbours were accustomed to Fairy—a
too suggestive name. They remembered
her quite a little thing, a lovely spoilt child,
a child who had never grown up. She was
still a little thing, and yet she was a woman—a
woman with a sharp tongue and a
despotic temper. Fairy had true fairy-like
fingers. She embroidered exquisitely, and
made considerable sums doing church
needlework, which sums were exclusively
devoted to the decoration of her own little
person. She was also a capital milliner
and amateur dressmaker; but she had no
taste for music, literature, housekeeping, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
for any of the “daily rounds, the common
tasks.” She left all those sort of things
to her sisters.</p>

<p>Honor, the youngest Miss Gordon, is
twenty years of age, slight, graceful, and
tall—perhaps too tall. She might have
spared some inches to her small relative,
for she measures fairly five feet eight inches.
She has an oval face, dark grey eyes, dark
hair, and a radiant smile. In a family less
distinguished by beauty she would have
been noteworthy. As it is, some people
maintain that in spite of Fairy’s marvellous
colouring and faultless features, they see
more to admire in her younger sister—for
she has the beauty of expression. Honor
is the useful member of the family. Jessie
could not arrange flowers, cut out a dress,
or make a cake, to save her life. Honor
can do all these. She has a sort of quick,
magic touch. Everything she undertakes
looks neat and dainty, from a hat to an
apple-pie. Her inexhaustible spirits correspond
with her gay, dancing eyes, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
is the life and prop of the whole establishment.
She plays the violin in quite a
remarkable manner. Not that she has great
execution, or can master difficult pieces,
but to her audience she and her violin
seem one, and there is a charm about her
playing that listeners can neither explain
nor resist.</p>

<p>The youngest Miss Gordon has her faults.
Chief of these, is an undesirable bluntness
and impudent recklessness of speech—a
deplorable fashion of introducing the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, no matter how unwelcome or how
naked—and a queer, half-absent, and
wholly disconcerting way of thinking
aloud.</p>

<p>Her friends (who are many) declare that
she is young, and will grow out of these
peculiarities, and at any rate she is by far
the most popular of the three sisters!</p>

<p>One gusty March morning, the sea displayed
towering grey waves, with cream-coloured
crests, the rain beat noisily against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the window in which Jessie Gordon stood
waiting for the kettle to boil, and watching
for the postman. Here he came at last,
striding up the paved path in his shining
oilskins, and with a thundering bang, bang!
he is gone.</p>

<p>“The paper, a coal bill, and an Indian
letter,” said Jessie to Fairy, who, wrapped
in a shawl, was cowering over the fire.
“I’ll take them upstairs whilst you watch
the kettle.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon always breakfasted in bed,
to “save trouble,” she declared, but to
whom she omitted to mention. She turned
the letters over languidly, and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“One from India from Sara Brande.
Wonders will never cease! What can she
want? Well, let me have my tea at once,
and when I have read her epistle, I will
send it down to you. And, here—you can
take the paper to Fairy.”</p>

<p>Jessie returned to her tea-making—she
and Honor took the housekeeping week
about. In the middle of breakfast, Susan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
stalked into the room—an unusual occurrence—and
said—</p>

<p>“Miss Jessie, the mistress is after pulling
down the bell-rope. I thought the house
was on fire. You are to go upstairs to her
this minute.”</p>

<p>Jessie was absent about a quarter of an
hour, and when she appeared, beaming, and
with a letter in her hand, she had such an
air of suppressed exultation, that it was
evident to her sisters, even before she
opened her lips, that the long-expected
“something” had happened at last.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br><span class="small">AN INDIAN LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Great, great news, girls!” cried Jessie,
waving the letter over her head. “Mrs.
Brande—I mean Aunt Sally—has written
to ask one of us to go out and live with
her, and she seems quite certain that her
offer will be accepted, for she encloses a
cheque for outfit and passage-money. It
is a short invitation, too; whoever elects
to see India must start within the next
fortnight.”</p>

<p>Honor and Fairy gazed at one another
incredulously, and Fairy’s delicate complexion
changed rapidly from pink to
crimson, from crimson to white.</p>

<p>“I’ll read it to you,” continued Jessie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
sitting down as she spoke. “The writing
is peculiar, and some of the words are only
underlined four times. Ahem!</p>

<p class="right">
“‘Rookwood, Shirani.<br>
</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sister-in-law</span>,</p>

<p>“‘It is not often that I take up
my pen, but I have something most important
to say to you. I am not as young as
I was, and I feel the want of some sort of
company. Pelham is away a good deal,
and I am left alone with Ben; he is the
best-hearted creature in the world, and
knows every word I say, but he can’t talk,
nor help in the housekeeping, nor go to
balls and church, being only a dog. What
would you think of letting me have one of
your girls? You have three, and might
spare one. Indeed, three unmarried
daughters must be a really terrible anxiety
to any mother. We expect to be home in
about a year, so if the worst comes to the
worst, you will have her back again in
twelve months’ time. Whoever you send,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
you may be sure I will be a mother to her,
and so will Pelham. She shall have the
best of everything in the way of society
and clothes, and I guarantee that she only
knows the <i>nicest beaux</i>, and that she will
be very happy. The hot weather is coming
on, and travelling after April is dangerous,
both by land and sea, so I would like you
to send her as soon as possible. She ought
to start not later than a fortnight after
you receive this, otherwise, it will be no
use her coming at all. She could not set
out again till October, and it would not be
worth her while to come to us for six
months. Pel encloses a cheque for her
passage, and thirty-five pounds extra for
boxes, gloves, petticoats, etc. I prefer to
devise her dresses <i>myself</i>, and will turn her
out smart. No doubt you are not in the
way of seeing the new fashions, and we are
uncommonly dressy out here. If she could
be in Bombay by the <i>middle of April</i>, I
could meet her at Allahabad and bring her
up, for I don’t approve of girls travelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
alone. Pel is anxious, too, and hopes you
won’t refuse us. You know he has a good
deal in his power; your girls are his <i>next-of-kin</i>,
and a nod is as good as a <i>wink</i> to
a blind horse—of course, not meaning that
<i>you</i> are a blind horse. This place is gay
in the season, and has plenty of tamashas;
as for snakes, there is no such thing; and
with regard to climate, you can make yourself
<i>quite</i> easy.</p>

<p>“‘The climatological conditions of these
hill-districts are a most important element
in their physical geography, and will therefore
require to be treated at considerable
length. An extensive discussion of the
meteorology cannot be attempted, but
sufficient data have already been collected
to serve as a basis for general description
of the climate. In this respect the Himalayas,
on account of their less distance
from the equator, present many points of
<i>advantage</i> as compared with the Alps and
other European mountains.’” (The above,
with the exception of the italics, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
been boldly copied from a gazetteer found
in Mr. Brande’s writing-room.)</p>

<p>“‘There is generally a fair sprinkling of
young men, and of course we entertain a
great deal. She shall have a nice quiet
pony, and a new <i>rickshaw</i>, so we shall expect
her without fail. Love to your daughters,
and especially to <i>our</i> one.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you think of that?”
inquired Jessie, looking alternately at her
two staring sisters.</p>

<p>“I say that it is a hoax, of course! Some
joke of yours, Jessie,” returned Honor, with
a playful snatch at the letter. “What is
all that gibberish about Uncle Pelham
being a mother to one, and mother not
being a blind horse, and the climatological
condition of the hills, not to mention the
snakes and the <i>beaux</i>? You ought to be
ashamed—I could have done it better
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Read it—examine the post-mark,” said
Jessie, now flinging it on the table.</p>

<p>Yes, there was no room for doubt; it was
a <i>bona-fide</i> Indian epistle. As Honor turned
it over critically, she suddenly exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Have you seen <i>this</i>—the gem of the
whole production—the postscript?”</p>

<p>Both sisters bent forward eagerly, and
there, just at the top of the last and otherwise
blank sheet, was scribbled as a hasty
afterthought—</p>

<p>“P.S.—Be sure you send the <i>pretty</i>
one.”</p>

<p>“She must be a most original old person,”
said Honor, with sparkling eyes. “And,
in the name of Dr. Johnson, what is a
‘tamasha’?”</p>

<p>“Ask me something easier,” rejoined
Jessie.</p>

<p>“Then what does mother say to this
remarkable invitation?”</p>

<p>“You might know better than to ask
that!” broke in Fairy, who had been
listening with evident impatience. “In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
this family it is, ‘What does Jessie say?’
What <i>do</i> you say, Jess?”</p>

<p>“I say, never refuse a good offer. It is
only for twelve months; and, of course, one
of us must go!”</p>

<p>“Then, will <i>you</i> go?” inquired Fairy,
with elevated brows.</p>

<p>“Am I the pretty one?” Jessie demanded
sarcastically. “I should be bundled back
by the next steamer.”</p>

<p>“No, of course; I never thought of that,”
rejoined her sister, meditatively. “I am
the pretty one; there has never been any
question of that—has there, girls?”</p>

<p>“No, never,” returned Jessie, in her
most matter-of-fact tone, and she and
Honor exchanged stealthy glances.</p>

<p>For some seconds Fairy seemed buried
in thought, as she drew patterns on the
table-cloth with a fork. At last she looked
up, and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“It is only for twelve months as you
say, Jess; twelve months soon fly round.”
And she threw back her shawl, and leant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
her elbows on the table. “Never refuse a
good offer—such as a pony, a rickshaw—whatever
that is—the new dresses, the best
society, the best <i>beaux</i>!” and she burst
into a peal of shrill laughter, as she exclaimed,
“Do you know, girls, that I think
I shall go!”</p>

<p>A pause, the result of utter stupefaction,
followed this unexpected announcement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she continued, with increased
animation, “I believe I should like it, of
all things. The idea grows on me. I am
thrown away here. What is the use of a
pretty face if it is never seen? Did she
say <i>thirty-five</i> pounds for outfit? I can
make that go a long way. I don’t take
yards of stuff, like you two giantesses. My
tailor-made and my spring dress are new.
I’ll just run up and talk it over with the
mater.” And she pushed back her chair,
and bustled out of the room.</p>

<p>Jessie and Honor remained gazing at
one another across the table, in dead suggestive
silence, which was at last broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
by Jessie, who said in a tone of quiet
despair—</p>

<p>“I wish that ridiculous letter had never
come. At first I thought it a capital thing.
I thought you ought to accept.”</p>

<p>“I!” cried Honor; “and, pray, why
should you select <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“For half a dozen excellent reasons; you
are pretty, young, bright, and popular.
You have a knack of making friends. All
the people about here and in the village
would rather have <i>your</i> little finger than
the rest of us put together. You walk
straight into their hearts, my love, and
therefore you are the most suitable member
of this family to be despatched to India
to ingratiate yourself with our rich relations.”</p>

<p>“Your fine compliments are wasted, Jess—your
‘butter’ thrown away—for I am not
going to India.”</p>

<p>“No; and Fairy has ere this selected
her steamer and travelling costume; if she
has made up her mind to go, nothing will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
stop her—and Uncle Pelham and Aunt
Sally have never been told that Fairy is—is—so
small. What <i>will</i> they say?” regarding
her sister with awestruck eyes and
a heightened colour.</p>

<p>What, indeed, would Mrs. Brande—who
was already boasting of her niece from
England, and loudly trumpeting the fame
of the lovely girl she expected—say to
Fairy? What would be her feelings when
she was called upon to welcome a remarkably
pretty little <i>dwarf</i>?</p>

<p>“It must be prevented,” murmured
Honor. “She cannot be allowed to go.”</p>

<p>“Is Fairy ever prevented from doing
what she wishes?” asked Jessie, with a
solemn face.</p>

<p>To this pertinent question her sister
could find no adequate reply. After a
pause she rose and said—</p>

<p>“Let us go upstairs, and hear what she
is saying to mother.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon was sitting up in bed
with a flushed face and anxious expression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
listening to the brilliant description of
Fairy’s future career in India.</p>

<p>Fairy, with both elbows on the bed, and
her pointed chin in her hands, was rapidly
enumerating her new dresses, and wondering
how soon they would be ready, declaring
how fortunate it was that she had a quantity
of patterns in the house, and that if her
mother would only advance twenty pounds
she could do wonders. She talked so incessantly,
and so volubly, that no one had a
chance of advising, objecting, or putting in
one single word. Her mother and sisters
listened in enforced, uneasy silence, to the
torrent of this little creature’s almost impassioned
eloquence.</p>

<p>“It will take a fortnight to get ready,”
she said. “This is the fifteenth of March;
what a scurry there will be! You two girls
will have to sew your fingers to the bone—won’t
they, mother?”</p>

<p>Her mother faltered a feeble assent.</p>

<p>“I shall want at least twelve gowns and
half a dozen hats. I must go into Hastings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
to-morrow.” She paused at last, with
scarlet cheeks, and quite breathless.</p>

<p>“There is nearly a week before the mail
goes out,” ventured Jessie; “and it is
rather too soon to decide yet. The letter
only came an hour ago, and there is much
to be considered, before mother can make
up her mind as to which of us she can
spare, and——”</p>

<p>“The whole thing is <i>quite</i> settled,” interrupted
Fairy in her sharpest key—Jessie
was not her favourite sister—“only you are
always so fond of interfering and managing
every one, from mother down. Aunt Sara
expressly asked for the pretty one; you
saw it in black and white, and mother
says I am to please myself—did you not,
mother?” appealing to her parent, whose
eyes sank guiltily before the reproachful
gaze of her eldest daughter. Nevertheless
she bravely sighed out—</p>

<p>“Yes, Fairy, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“There!” cried Fairy, triumphantly.
“You see mother has decided, and I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
decided. I am not like some people, who
take weeks to make up their minds, especially
when moments are precious. I must
write a quantity of letters for the early post.
Honor, do you remember the name of Mrs.
Travers’ dressmaker? and do you think I
should get a habit and riding-boots?”</p>

</div>


<p>The astonishing news that had come to
Merry Meetings, was soon shared by the
entire village, thanks to Susan’s sister, who
filled the post of messenger and charwoman.
The letter was warmly discussed, in the
sanded parlour of The Cause is Altered
inn, over the counter at Hogben’s the
grocer, at the rectory, at Dr. Banks’, and
also by the Trevors—the family at the hall—a
family to whom the Misses Gordon
were indebted for most of their trivial
gaieties. Opinion, whether in hall or tap-room,
was for once unanimous. Of course
one of the Gordons must accept her rich
uncle’s offer, and that without any foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
or unnecessary delay. Although it was a
wet afternoon, Cara and Sophy Trevor,
Mrs. Banks, the rector, and Mrs. Kerry,
arrived almost simultaneously at Merry
Meetings, and half filled the drawing-room;
which was of moderate size, with a
southern aspect, and deep comfortable
window-seats. The furniture was old-fashioned,
and the carpet threadbare, but
a few wicker chairs, a couple of Persian
rugs, a quantity of pictures, books, flowers,
and needlework, covered many deficiencies;
it was the general sitting-room of the
family, and if not always perfectly tidy,
was at any rate delightfully home-like,
vastly different to so many of its name-sakes,
which have a fire on stated days;
gaunt, formal apartments, solely devoted to
visitors. Mrs. Gordon’s friends dropped in
at all hours, but chiefly at five o’clock, and
the tea and hot cakes, dispensed at Merry
Meetings, were considered unequalled in
those parts.</p>

<p>Behold a selection of Mrs. Gordon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
nearest neighbours gathered eagerly round
her hearth, whilst Honor made tea in thin,
old shallow cups.</p>

<p>“We all met at the gate!” explained
Cara Trevor, “and have come, as you see,
to call on you in a body, to hear your news
with our very own ears. Is it true, dear
lady, that one of the girls is going out to
India immediately?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Gordon. “I heard
from my sister-in-law this morning, she and
my brother are most anxious to have one
of their nieces on a visit; they give us very
short notice—only a fortnight. Honor, my
love, Cara will take another cake.”</p>

<p>“No, no, thank you,” cried Miss Trevor,
impatiently. “Pray do go on, and tell me
all about this delightful invitation, Honor.
Where is your uncle; in what part of
India?”</p>

<p>“He is at Shirani, a hill station, most of
the year. I believe he has rather a good
appointment, something to do with the
revenue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“I know all about Shirani,” answered
Sophy Trevor, with an air of unusual
importance. “We had a cousin quartered
there once; it is a capital place for shooting,
dancing, picnics, and tennis-parties—so
different to this dead and alive Hoyle.
It really ought to be spelt without the <i>y</i>.
I wish some one would ask <i>me</i> to India. I
would be ready to start to-night, with just a
couple of basket-trunks and a dressing-bag.
Which of you is going? I suppose you have
not thought of it yet?” but she looked
straight at Honor.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is quite settled,” rejoined Fairy,
in her clear shrill voice. “It was decided
at once, as there is not a second to spare.
You are to lose <i>me</i>,” and she laughed
affectedly. She had an extraordinarily loud
laugh for such a little woman.</p>

<p>But there was no responding echo—no,
not even a smile; on the contrary, an
expression of blank consternation settled
down on every countenance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Banks was the first to recover the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
power of speech, as with a somewhat
hysterical giggle, she remarked to the company
the self-evident fact—</p>

<p>“I suppose the Indian mail came in
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Jessie, adding significantly,
“and goes out on Thursday, so we
have not sent an answer to Uncle Pelham
as yet.”</p>

<p>“He does not know what is in store for
him,” murmured Mrs. Kerry to Mrs. Banks,
as she rose and put her tea-cup on a table
beside her. Meanwhile Fairy had produced
a number of bundles of patterns of dress
materials, and requested the two Miss
Trevors to give an opinion of their merits.
This created a merciful diversion. Most
women enjoy turning over patterns, even
patterns for mourning, and in desultory
talk about dressmakers and chiffons, the
visit came to a close.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear such an utterly
crazy notion?” cried Mrs. Banks, as soon
as she and the two Miss Trevors were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
outside the hall door. “I could scarcely
believe my senses.”</p>

<p>“And no wonder,” said Sophy Trevor.
“She should not be allowed to go; but she
is so desperately obstinate, that if she has
made up her mind to start, all England
will not stop her.”</p>

<p>“My husband shall stop her,” returned
Mrs. Banks, emphatically. “He shall put
it on her health, and say that she is too
delicate, and that the climate will kill
her!”</p>

<p>“I doubt if even that would keep her at
home,” said Cara, who knew Fairy well.
“How wretched Mrs. Gordon looked.
Fairy is her idol, and turns her round her
little finger, and I like Fairy the least of
the family—she is so selfish and so vain.
Poor Honor is her slave, and indeed they
all give in to her far too much; but if they
allow her to go out to India, they will never
see a penny of their rich uncle’s money.
He is expecting a nice, comely, ordinary
girl, not a little monster!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Cara!” protested her sister, in a
deeply shocked voice.</p>

<p>“Well, you know she <i>is</i> a monster of
selfishness and vanity,” retorted Cara with
unabashed persistence.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Kerry, who was trudging
behind with his wife, displayed an unusually
elongated upper lip—sure sign of excessive
mental perturbation.</p>

<p>“Preposterous!” he exclaimed. “That
child exercises a most baneful influence
over her parent. I must see Mrs. Gordon
alone, and reason her out of this insane
project.”</p>

<p>“And so you will, no doubt, in five
minutes,” assented his partner briskly,
“and as soon as you have left, Fairy will
reason her back again. Surely, my dear,
you know Mrs. Gordon? The whole
matter rests in Fairy’s hands, and our only
hope is that she may change her mind, or
get the influenza, and there is but little
chance of either.”</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the Rev. James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
to expostulate angrily with his companion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next three days were a period
of unexampled misery to most of the
inmates at Merry Meetings. Fairy was
feverishly gay and feverishly busy. Though
a severe cold kept her at home, she was
never separated from her beloved patterns,
no, not even when in bed. Most of her
time was spent in writing to shops, making
calculations in pencil, trimming hats, and
searching through fashion-plates. She
now had but two topics of conversation,
India and dress. Meanwhile her mother
and sisters looked on, powerless, and in a
manner paralyzed by the sturdy will of this
small autocrat. In these days there was
considerable traffic to and fro from Merry
Meetings, and an unusual amount of
knocks and rings at Mrs. Gordon’s modest
little green hall door. The postman, instead
of bringing one paper and a meagre
envelope as of yore, now staggered under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
a load of large brown-paper parcels, and
an immense variety of card-board boxes.
Telegrams were an every-day arrival, and
letters poured in by the dozen. Fairy’s
preparations were advancing steadily,
though her sisters whispered gravely to
one another, that “she must not be allowed
to go.” Who was to prevent her? Not
her mother, who sat in her usual armchair,
looking harassed and woe-begone, and now
and then heaved heartrending sighs and
applied a damp pocket-handkerchief to her
eyes.</p>

<p>Not the rector. He had reasoned with
Fairy long and, as he believed, eloquently;
but in vain. He pointed out her mother’s
grief, her great reluctance to part with her
favourite child, her own uncertain health,
but he spoke to deaf ears; and Dr.
Banks, despite his wife’s proud boast, fared
but little better. He solemnly assured
Fairy that she was not fit to go to India,
to undertake the long journey alone; and,
whatever her aunt might say, the climate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
was only suited to people with robust
constitutions. “Was she robust?” he
demanded with asperity.</p>

<p>“He knew best,” she retorted in her
pertest manner. “One thing she did know,
she was <i>going</i>. Her aunt had especially
invited her, and why should she not have
some amusement and see something of
the world? instead of being buried alive
at Hoyle. It was not living, it was
mouldering.”</p>

<p>“At any rate she would live longer at
Hoyle than in India,” the doctor angrily
assured her. He was furious with this
selfish, egotistical scrap of humanity, who
had always secured the best of everything
that fell to the lot of her impoverished
family.</p>

<p>“As for amusement,” he continued, “she
would not find it very amusing to be laid
up perhaps for weeks. She was a feverish
subject, had she thought of the sicknesses
that periodically scourged the East—cholera
and small-pox?” Fairy, who was constitutionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
nervous, shuddered visibly. “Had
she thought of long journeys on horse-back,
she who shrieked if the donkey cocked his
ears! She was, in his opinion, much too
delicate and too helpless to think of
leaving home.”</p>

<p>Her determination was somewhat shaken
by Dr. Banks’ visit, and by a feverish cold;
was it a foretaste of India already? But
where filial duty and fear had failed to
move her, vanity stepped in, and secured a
complete surrender!</p>

<p>The spoiled child of the family was sitting
alone in the drawing-room late one afternoon,
sewing pleasant anticipations and
serious misgivings, alternately, into a smart
silk blouse, when her thoughts were
suddenly scattered by a loud and unfamiliar
double knock. She heard a man’s voice in
the hall, and had barely time to throw off
her shawl, and give her hair a touch before
the glass, when Susan announced, “Mr.
Oscar Crabbe.” He was a rising artist who
had been staying in the neighbourhood at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Christmas, and had made no secret of his
profound admiration for Miss Fairy Gordon,
from a purely professional standpoint.</p>

<p>Oscar Crabbe was a good-looking man,
with a pleasant voice, a luxuriant brown
beard, and an off-hand, impetuous manner.</p>

<p>“Pray excuse my calling at this unceremonious
hour,” he said as he advanced
with a cold, outstretched hand. “I believe
it is long after five o’clock; but, as I was
passing, I thought I would drop in on
chance of finding some one at home. How
are your mother and sisters?”</p>

<p>“My mother is lying down with a
nervous headache; my sisters are shopping
in Hastings, so you will have to put up
with <i>me</i>,” said Fairy, coquettishly.</p>

<p>“And you are the very person I most
wish to see,” returned Mr. Crabbe, drawing
his chair closer as he spoke. “I want to
ask you to do me a tremendous favour—I
want to paint your portrait for next year’s
academy.”</p>

<p>“My portrait?” she echoed tremulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; I said something to you at
Christmas, you may remember.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were joking.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! I was simply feeling my
way; and, if you will honour me with a few
sittings, I shall be deeply grateful. I propose
to paint you as Rowena—full life size.
You are an ideal Rowena.”</p>

<p>“And when?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not for some months—not before
autumn. But I always take time by the
forelock; and as I was down here at the
Trevors” (had Cara Trevor instigated this
visit? History is silent, and the true facts
will never be divulged) “I thought I would
seize the opportunity of bespeaking a model
for next season. I will only ask you to sit
to me for the head and hands; the dress
and figure I can work at in town. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Crabbe,” clasping her tiny
hands rapturously, “I should have liked it
beyond anything in the whole wide world.
I am so sorry, but——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“But your mother would not approve?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. She would be enchanted;
but I am going to India immediately.”</p>

<p>“To India?” he repeated, after an expressively
long pause.</p>

<p>“Yes; my aunt and uncle have invited
one of us—it was most unexpected—and I
am going.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crabbe looked grave; then he gave
a sort of awkward laugh, and said—</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Gordon, I enroll myself
among the number of friends who deeply
deplore your departure. I am extremely
sorry—indeed, I have a double reason for
regret, for I shall never find such a
Rowena!”</p>

<p>“And I am extremely sorry too. There
will be no one in India who will want to
paint my picture.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that. A young
fellow, a friend of mine, went out there
last October globe-trotting. He is the
cleverest portrait painter I know, though
he calls himself an amateur and only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
paints for amusement, and in interludes of
hunting and polo-playing. He has not to
work for his daily bread, like the rest of
us; but, if he had to do so, he would make
his fortune if he studied and put his
shoulder to the wheel. He has a genius
for catching a true likeness, a natural attitude,
a characteristic expression, and he
does it all so easily and so quickly. A few
rapid dashes, and the canvas seems to <i>live</i>.
It is a pity he does not take to our profession
seriously and study; but his uncle
abhors ‘painting chaps,’ as he calls them;
and his uncle, whose heir he is, is a
millionaire.”</p>

<p>“How nice! And what is the name of
this fortunate young man?”</p>

<p>“Mark Jervis.”</p>

<p>“I must try and remember. Perhaps I
may come across him, and he may paint
my picture; but it will be nothing in comparison
to having it done by <i>you</i> and hung
in the Royal Academy.”</p>

<p>She turned her face upon her visitor with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
an expression of dreamy ecstasy. A delicate
colour, a brilliant sparkle in her eyes, the
becoming background of a red lamp-shade,
which set off her perfect profile, all combined
to heighten the effect of Fairy’s
transcendent beauty; and Oscar Crabbe
frankly assured himself that he was then
and there gazing upon the face of the most
lovely girl in England. As he gazed, he
lost his head, and stammered out rapturously—</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could only paint you as you are
now, my reputation would be assured; you
would make me famous!”</p>

<p>“You mean that you would make <i>me</i>
famous,” she returned, dropping her eyes
bashfully. “Do you know that you almost
tempt me to abandon India and remain at
home?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. You are of far too
delicate clay for the fierce tropical sun, and
India plays the devil—I mean,” picking
himself up, “it is the grave of beauty. If
anything should happen to prevent your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
carrying out your trip, will you let me
know without fail?”</p>

<p>“You may be certain that I shall.”</p>

<p>“I wonder that one of your sisters——”
he began, when the door opened and admitted
the two ladies in question. They
were cold, tired, longing for tea, and offered
no serious resistance to Mr. Crabbe’s immediate
departure. He held Fairy’s hand in
his for several seconds, as if reluctant to
release it, and he gave it a faint but distinctly
perceptible pressure as he said, “I
will not say, ‘Bon voyage,’ but, ‘Au revoir.’
Remember your promise,” and hurried away.</p>

<p>It was noticed by her relations that Fairy
was unusually silent all that evening. She
seemed buried in thought, and her pretty
white forehead was actually knit into
wrinkles, as she stitched with deft and rapid
fingers. To tell the truth, the young lady
was carefully weighing the pros and cons
respecting her Eastern trip. She lay awake
for hours that night, revolving various
questions in her busy little brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>On one hand, she would escape from
Hoyle and enjoy a gay and novel existence.
She would be taken to balls and parties,
and be the cynosure of all eyes; she would
have plenty of pocket-money, plenty of
pretty dresses, plenty of luxuries—that was
one side of the shield. On the reverse, she
mentally saw a hateful journey by sea, an
unaccustomed life and climate, an ever-haunting
dread of fever, cholera, snakes;
she would probably have to accustom herself
to riding wild ponies, to being borne
along the brinks of frightful precipices; she
would have no one to pet her and hunt up
her things, and do her hair and mend her
gloves—yes, she would miss Honor dreadfully.
Mr. Crabbe had assured her that
India was the grave of beauty. Supposing
she became a fright! Dr. Banks had
hinted at shattered health. No, after all,
she would remain at home; her aunt and
uncle would be in England in a year’s time,
she would pay them a nice long visit
without risking either health or looks;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
then there would be <i>Rowena</i>, a lasting and
substantial triumph! She had visions of
her picture hanging on the line in the
Royal Academy, and guarded by police in
order to keep the surging mob of admirers
at bay, of crowds gazing spell-bound at her
portrait, of notices in the society papers,
of photographs in shop windows, of wide
celebrity, and the acknowledgment of her
beauty in the face of all England.</p>

<p>The prospect was intoxicating. Towards
dawn she fell asleep, and enjoyed delightful
dreams.</p>

<p>The next morning, ere descending to
breakfast, she called her sisters into her
room, and said, in an unusually formal
manner—</p>

<p>“Jessie and Honor, I may as well tell
you that I have changed my mind, and
given up all idea of going to India, so I
thought you ought to know at once.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear it,” replied
Jessie, with unaffected relief. “But why?”
surveying her with questioning eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
“Why have you so suddenly altered your
plans?”</p>

<p>“I have been lying awake all night,
thinking of mother,” was the mendacious
reply. “I see she is fretting dreadfully;
it would break her heart to part with me,
and I shall never leave her, or at least,”
correcting herself, “never leave England.”</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate that you did not think
of mother a little sooner!” said Jessie,
glancing round the room, which was
blocked up with boxes and parcels containing
purchases in the shape of hats and
shoes and jackets, and many articles “on
approval.” “I think you are very wise to
stay at home; but it is a pity that you
have made such great preparations. Is it
not, Honor?”</p>

<p>“No doubt <i>you</i> think so,” retorted Fairy,
sarcastically. “Of course it seems a pity
that none of my pretty new things will fit
either of <i>you</i>.”</p>

</div>


<p>Now that, to every one’s intense relief,
Fairy had changed her mind and withdrawn
her claim, the question remained,
Who was to go? Public opinion, her
mother, Jessie—in short, every voice save
one, said Honor. But Honor was indisposed
to visit the East. She was not an
enterprising young woman, and she was
fond of home; and Fairy, when alone with
her, shed showers of crocodile tears every
time the subject was mentioned. She
could not bear to part with her favourite
sister; no, it was too cruel of people to
suggest such a thing. Who, she asked
herself, would dress her hair, and button<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
her boots, and read her to sleep? And
many of Honor’s hateful tasks would fall to
her, such as arranging the flowers, dusting
the drawing-room, housekeeping, going
messages, for Jessie’s time meant money,
and must be respected. Aloud, in the
family circle, she said in authoritative tones,
“Let Jessie go! As to looks, <i>any</i> looks
are good enough for India; even Jessie
will seem handsome there. After all, why
should any of them accept the invitation?
England was a free country. She (Fairy)
would send a nice, grateful little letter, and
keep the cheque. Uncle Pelham would
never be so mean as to take it back, and
they would buy a pony instead of that
maddening donkey, and make a tennis-ground,
and take a fortnight’s trip to
London, and enjoy themselves for once in
their lives.”</p>

<p>A week elapsed. The mail had gone out
without an answer to Mr. Brande. Jessie
and her mother had both talked seriously
to Honor, and she had listened with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
pleasantest smile, whilst they pointed out
the advantages she would personally reap
from her Eastern trip. She made no
attempt to argue the point, only asked in a
playful way who was to drive the donkey?
Who was to play the harmonium in church?
for she flattered herself that she was the
only person in the parish who could do
either. And there was the garden and the
poultry—the hens would be lost without
her!</p>

<p>“We shall <i>all</i> be lost without you,”
rejoined Jessie; “but we can spare you for
your own good.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be spared for my own
good,” she answered. “I prefer staying at
home. You think that I shall carry all
before me out there! You are greatly
mistaken. All your geese are swans. <i>I</i>
am a goose, and not a swan. I am just a
country cousin, with a bad complexion and
uncouth manners.”</p>

<p>“Honor! you have a beautiful skin,
only not much colour; and as for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
manners, they are as good as other
people’s.”</p>

<p>“You have often said that mine are
alarmingly abrupt, and that I have the
habits of a savage or a child in the way I
blurt out home-truths.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but only at home; and you must
not <i>always</i> mind what I say.”</p>

<p>“Then what about the present moment?
When you say that I ought to go out to
Uncle Pelham—how am I to know that I
ought to mind what you say now?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Honor, you are really
too provoking!”</p>

<p>Little did Mrs. Gordon and her friends
suspect how their weighty reasons and
arguments were nullified by Fairy, who
nightly, with arms wound tightly round her
sister’s neck, and face pressed to hers,
whispered, “You won’t go; promise me,
you won’t go.”</p>

<p>Jessie, the clear-sighted, at last began to
suspect that Fairy was at the bottom of
her sister’s reluctance to acquiesce. Fairy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
was so demonstratively affectionate to
Honor. This was unusual. It was too
bad, that Fairy should rule her family, and
that her wishes should be law. Jessie
conferred with her mother, and they agreed
to try another plan. They would drop the
subject, and see if feminine contrariness
would be their good friend? The word
“India” was therefore not uttered for
three whole precious days; patterns and
passages, etc., were no longer discussed,
matters fell back into their old monotonous
groove, save that Mrs. Gordon frequently
gazed at her youngest daughter, and heaved
unusually long and significant sighs.</p>

<p>One afternoon, ten days after the letter
had been received which still lay unanswered
in Mrs. Gordon’s desk, Honor
met the rector as she was returning from
practising Sunday hymns on the wheezy
old harmonium.</p>

<p>“This will be one of your last practices,”
he said. “I am sure I don’t know <i>how</i> we
are to replace you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Why should you replace me?” she
asked. “I am not going away.”</p>

<p>“Not going away,” he repeated. “I
understood that it was all settled. Why
have you changed your mind?”</p>

<p>“I never made up my mind to go.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Think of all the advantages
you will gain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, advantages; that is what Jessie
is always drumming into my head. I shall
see the world, I shall have pretty dresses,
and a pony, and plenty of balls and parties,
and new friends.”</p>

<p>“And surely you would enjoy all these—you
are only nineteen, Honor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but these delights are for myself;
there is nothing for <i>them</i>,” nodding towards
“Merry Meetings.” “I am the only person
who will benefit by this visit, and I am sure I
am more wanted at home than out in India.
Jessie cannot do everything, her writing
takes up her time; and I look after the
house and garden. And then there is Fairy;
she cannot bear me to leave her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“You have spoiled Fairy among you,”
cried the rector, irritably. “Only the
other day she was crazy to go to India
<i>herself</i>. She must learn to give up, like
other people. It is very wrong to sacrifice
yourself to the whims and fancies of your
sister; in the long run they will become a
yoke of dreadful bondage. Remember that
you are not a puppet, nor an idiot, but a
free, rational agent.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the girl. She knew she
was now in for one of Mr. Kerry’s personal
lectures. It might be over in two or three
minutes, and it might continue for half an
hour.</p>

<p>“Now listen to me, Honor. I know you
are a good, honest young woman, and think
this plan will only benefit yourself. You are
wrong. Your mother is in poor health; her
pension dies with her. If you offend your
only near relative, how are you to exist?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we can work. Every woman
ought to be able to earn her bread—even if
it is without butter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“Honor, I did not know that you held
these emancipated views. I hope you
won’t let any other man hear you airing
them. As for work! Can Fairy work?
Jessie, I know, can earn a few pounds, but
she could barely keep herself; and if you
fall sick, what will you do? It is best to
survey matters from every standpoint. Your
aunt and uncle have practically offered to
adopt you. You will return in a year’s
time; you will have made many friends for
yourself and sisters, developed your own at
present limited views of the world, and
bring many new interests into your life.
Your absence from home will be a considerable
saving. Have you thought of that?”</p>

<p>“A saving!” she echoed incredulously.</p>

<p>“Of course! Don’t you eat? A healthy
girl like you cannot live on air; and there
is your dress.”</p>

<p>“I make my own dresses.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” with an impatient whirl of
his stick. “You don’t make the material.
How can you be so stubborn, so wilfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
blind to your own interests. If another girl
had your chances, Honor Gordon would be
the very first to urge her to go; and that in
her most knock-me-down style. You have
a much keener view where other people’s
affairs are concerned than your own.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it is only for a year,” said
Honor. “I shall be back among you all
within twelve months.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you are not married,” added the
rector, rashly.</p>

<p>“It appears to be the general impression
in Hoyle, that going to India means going
to be married,” said the girl, firing up and
looking quite fierce. “Please put that
idea quite at one side, as far as <i>I</i> am concerned.”</p>

<p>“Very well, my dear, I will,” was the
unexpectedly meek response.</p>

<p>Touched by his humility, she continued,
“Then you really think I <i>ought</i> to go?”</p>

<p>“My good child, there can be no two
opinions. Every one thinks you ought
to go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“Except Fairy.”</p>

<p>“Fairy has no right to stand in your
way, and your absence will be an excellent
lesson for her. She will learn to be independent
and useful. Now, here is my turn,
and I must leave you. Go straight home
and tell them that you are ready to start,
and that the sooner your mother sees about
your escort and passage the better.”</p>

<p>And he wrung her hand and left her.
Honor walked home at a snail’s pace, thinking
hard. If Fairy would but give her consent,
she would hold out no longer against
every one’s wishes. She would go—yes,
without further hesitation. After all, it
was only for one year. But, although she
did not know it, Fairy had already yielded.
Jessie and Mrs. Banks had been talking to
her seriously in Honor’s absence, and she
had been persuaded to listen to the voice
of reason—and interest.</p>

<p>If she had gone to India, as she intended,
she would have been parted from Honor,
and of her own accord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>This fact, brusquely placed before her by
Mrs. Banks, she was unable to deny, and
sat dumb and sullen.</p>

<p>“Uncle Pelham is sure to take to Honor,”
added Jessie, “and he will probably do
something for us all, thinking that we are
<i>all</i> as nice as Honor, which is not the case.
She will be home in a year, and there will
be her letter every week.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and <i>presents</i>,” put in Mrs. Banks,
significantly. “She will have plenty of
pocket-money, and will be able to send you
home no end of nice things.”</p>

<p>Fairy sniffed and sighed, dabbed her eyes
with her handkerchief, and finally suffered
herself to be coaxed and convinced, and
when her sister opened the drawing-room
door, with rather a solemn face, she ran to
her and put her arms round her and said—</p>

<p>“Honor, darling, I have promised to let
you go!”</p>

<p>That very day the important epistle was
despatched to Shirani, and Fairy, to show
that she did nothing by halves, actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
dropped it into the letter-box with her own
hand. And during the evening she once
more produced the bundles of patterns,
and threw herself heart and soul into the
selection of her sister’s outfit.</p>

</div>


<p>The grand dinner-party at 500, Princes
Gate, was over, the last silken train had
swept down the steps, the last brougham
had bowled away, and a somewhat bored-looking
young man indulged in a stretch
and a prodigious yawn, and strolled slowly
back to the library, where the master of the
house, a spruce little person of sixty, with
a rosy cheek and active eye, stood before
the empty fireplace (the month was June)
with his coat-tails under his arms, engaged
in chewing a tooth-pick. Wealthy he may
be, judging from his surroundings, but he
is certainly not distinguished in appearance;
his scanty locks are brushed out into two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
sharp horns over his large ears. In spite of
his blazing solitaire stud and faultless claw-hammer
coat, he is plebeian; yes, from
the points of his patent leather shoes to
the crown of his bald head. It is difficult
to believe that he is the uncle of the aristocratic
young fellow who has just entered
and cast himself into a deep armchair.
What the French call “the look of race,”
is the principal thing that strikes one about
Mark Jervis. It is afterwards—possibly
some time afterwards—that you realize the
fact that he is remarkably handsome, and
considerably older than you took him to be
at the first glance. His smooth face and
sunny hazel eyes are misleading: young
Jervis is more than nineteen, he is five and
twenty.</p>

<p>“Well, Mark, that’s over, thank God,”
exclaimed Mr. Pollitt. “I hate these big
dinners; but your aunt will have them.
She says we owe them; women are never
backward in paying <i>those</i> sort of debts. It
was well done, hey? That new <i>chef</i> is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
success. Did you taste the Perdreaux aux
Chartreuse—or the Bouchée à la financière,
or that cold <i>entrée</i>?”</p>

<p>“No, Uncle Dan,” strangling another
great yawn.</p>

<p>“Ah, you sly dog! You were too much
taken up with Lady Boadicea! She is
considered a beauty—at least her picture
made rather a stir. What do you think?
How does she strike <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>“To me—she looks like a wax doll that
has been held too close to the fire—and she
is about as animated.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t say that of the American
girl, Miss Clapper—there’s a complexion!—there’s
animation!—there’s a stunner for
you!”</p>

<p>“A stunner, indeed! She thrust her
money down my throat in such enormous
quantities that I could scarcely swallow
anything else!”</p>

<p>“Then why the deuce did you not stuff
some of <i>mine</i> down hers, hey?” chuckling.
“I saw you at Hurlingham this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Did you, sir? I had no idea you were
there.”</p>

<p>“It was a frightful squash—hardly a
chair to be had; the Royalties, a fine day
and a popular match, brought ’em. I suppose
that was the new pony you were
trying, brown with white legs. How do
you like him?”</p>

<p>“He is not handy, and he is a bit slow.
He is not in the same class with Pipe-clay,
or the chestnut Arab; I don’t think we will
buy him, sir.”</p>

<p>“Lord Greenleg was very anxious to
hear what I thought of him. He only
wants a hundred and thirty—asked me to
give him an answer there and then, as he
had another customer, but I thought I had
better wait till I heard your opinion. Is
the pony worth one hundred and thirty
guineas? What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say, cut off the first figure, and that
is about his value,” rejoined his nephew
shortly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pollitt looked blank. He rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
liked buying ponies from lords, even at a
high figure, but a hundred guineas too
much was a stiff sum. He knew that he
could rely on the young fellow’s opinion,
for lazy as he seemed, lounging there in an
easy chair, he could both buy a horse and
ride a horse—which does not always follow.
The languid-looking youth was a hard rider
to hounds, and a finished polo player.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose we shan’t mind the
brown, eh, Mark?” said his uncle rather
dolefully. “After all, it is getting late in the
season, and his lordship has another offer.”</p>

<p>“<i>Has</i> he!” expressively. “Oh, then,
that is all right.”</p>

<p>“Your side played up well to-day, my
boy!”</p>

<p>“And were well beaten—two goals to
four. Johnny Brind is no good as a back.
He sits doubled up in his saddle, like an
angry cat, and lets the ball roll out between
his pony’s fore legs—and his language!”</p>

<p>“That did not come as far as my ears. I
saw you speaking to Lord Robert Tedcastle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
You were at Eton with him—you might
bring him home to lunch some Sunday;
and that Italian prince, did you come across
him?” anxiously.</p>

<p>“No; I did not see him.”</p>

<p>“I noticed you having a long talk with
that young Torrens; what was he yarning
about? He was nodding his head and
waving his hands like a cheap toy.”</p>

<p>“He was telling me of his plans. He
and his brother are off to America next
week, they are going on to Japan, Australia,
and India. I say, Uncle Dan,” suddenly
sitting erect, “I wish you would let <i>me</i>
travel for a couple of years and see the
world.”</p>

<p>A silence of nearly a minute, and then
Mr. Pollitt burst out—</p>

<p>“Now, this is some stuff that young ass
Torrens has been putting into your head.
To see the world! What world? You see
it at home. England is the world. You
have the best of everything here—the
handsomest women, finest horses, best food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
and drink, best——” he paused, and his
nephew, who was nursing his leg, blandly
suggested “climate.”</p>

<p>“Climate be hanged! best society,”
bawled Mr. Pollitt. “The fact of the
matter is, you young chaps don’t know
when you are well off. Travel—see the
world—skittles!”</p>

<p>“I know that I am exceedingly well off,
thanks to you, Uncle Dan,” rejoined his
nephew, quietly. “I have capital polo
ponies, a first-rate stud of hunters, a
splendid allowance—but a fellow can’t play
polo, and hunt, and go to balls and theatres
all his life; at least, that’s not <i>my</i> idea of
life. I have nothing to do, no profession,
you know; you would not hear of my going
into the service.”</p>

<p>“No—I hate the army—what prospect
does it offer the young idiots who are
slaving to get into it—to live vagabonds,
and die beggars!”</p>

<p>“There was the diplomatic corps; but
I’ve not brains enough for that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Bosh! You don’t want a profession,
taking bread out of other people’s mouths.
You are my heir—<i>that’s</i> your profession.
As to intellect, there is a great deal too
much intellect in these days; the world
would be far easier to govern if there
was less! You have brains enough, my
boy, you did very well at Oxford.”</p>

<p>“I know that I am very fortunate,”
repeated the young man, “and that thousands
of fellows would give anything to
stand in my shoes.”</p>

<p>“Clarence for one,” interrupted his uncle,
with a loud chuckle.</p>

<p>“But I’m sick of the eternal treadmill
round of the London season—Ascot, Goodwood,
Cowes, Scotland. Then back to
London, and we begin the whole business
over again. We see the same people, and
do the same things.”</p>

<p>“How old are you, Mark?” broke in
Mr. Pollitt, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Five and twenty.”</p>

<p>“One would think you were eighty-five!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
But it is all the rage to be bored and <i>blasé</i>,
and to give out that life is not worth living.
You are in the height of the fashion, my
boy! The fact of the matter is—that you
are too prosperous. A blow of real trouble,
cutting to the very bone, would do you no
harm.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so. Properly speaking, I believe
I ought to have been a poor man’s son, and
had to work my way. I feel that I could
do it. I would not have minded being a
soldier, a sailor, an explorer, or even a
stock-rider.”</p>

<p>“In fact, to put the matter in a nutshell,
anything but what you <i>are</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, Uncle Dan, you have fought your
way up to the front, step by step, and won
your spurs, and enjoyed the battle. I
should like to take some weapon, and strike
into the fray.” Here he suddenly got up,
and came over to his uncle, and, putting his
hand affectionately on his shoulder said,
“I would like to do something to make
you”—with a nervous laugh—“proud of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
me;” and as he looked into his uncle’s
shrewd little face, his eyes shone with
repressed excitement.</p>

<p>“I’m proud enough. You are my own
flesh and blood—a good-looking chap, a
capital rider, and a gentleman; a bit too
fond of dabbling with your nasty, dirty oil
paints, a bit dreamy and Quixotic, but——”</p>

<p>At this juncture the door was gently
pushed open, and a long, hooked nose came
slowly into the room, followed by a tall,
thin, elderly lady, attired in a clinging mist-coloured
robe, and blazing with diamonds.
A sallow, discontented-looking person, with
a high-bred air, despite her touzled fringe.</p>

<p>“So you are <i>both</i> here!” she murmured
sweetly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Mr. Pollitt; “and here is
Mark,” waving a short square hand towards
him. “What do you think is his last craze,
Selina? He wants to travel for a couple of
years, in order to see the world. Just like
the hero of a fairy tale.”</p>

<p>Mark hastened to place a chair for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
aunt, into which she gently sank, keeping
her eyes steadily fixed on his as she did so,
and gradually narrowing her gaze to a cat-like
glint.</p>

<p>“Do you know that I rather <i>like</i> the idea!”
she remarked, after a momentary silence.
“I think it is a shocking thing for a young
man to waste his life, lounging in clubs
gossipping and gambling, or playing a game
on the back of a pony. Travelling improves
the mind and enlarges the ideas.” Here,
catching sight of Mr. Pollitt’s face of angry
scorn, she lost no time in adding, “You
know, it is all the fashion to travel, it’s only
the second-rate people and nobodies who
stay at home. Lady Grace and Lord Kenneth
are going out to India this cold weather,
so is the Duke of Saltminster, the Marquis
and Marchioness of Tordale, and crowds of
other smart people.”</p>

<p>Smart people were to Mr. Pollitt, as his
crafty wife knew, the very salt of the earth;
and his expression changed from that of
repressed fury to grave attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“India! Perhaps I would not mind so
much,” he admitted, after a pause. “The
boy was born there, and he could look up
his father. Yes, and he might have some
shooting, and pick up a few tigers, and nice
acquaintances and companions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, of course, Mark could not
travel alone, dear. He must have a pleasant
and experienced——”</p>

<p>“Bear-leader or keeper; or what would
you say to a chaperon?” broke in her
husband.</p>

<p>“My dearest!” she gravely expostulated.
“You know perfectly well that it would be
frightfully dull for the poor boy roaming
about the country with no one to keep him
company, not knowing where to go, or what
to say. Now Clarence,” and she hesitated.</p>

<p>“Yes—now Clarence. What now?”
sharply.</p>

<p>“Clarence,” speaking very distinctly,
“was stationed in India for eight years.
He is an experienced Anglo-Indian, has
hundreds of friends, talks Hindostani fluently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
and could get no end of shooting and introductions
to native <i>princes</i>” (great emphasis
on princes). “He would be a capital guide
for Mark.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” with a short laugh. “I’m
not so sure of that, Mrs. Pollitt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Dan, he is perfectly steady
now. Why, he is thirty-five, and has sown
his wild oats. I never quite believe in these
wonderfully good young men,” and she shot
a swift glance at Mark. “Except Mark, of
course, and he ought to have been a parson,
and,” with a little sneer, “he may yet become
a missionary.”</p>

<p>“But India is no novelty to Clarence,”
protested Mr. Pollitt; “and, by all accounts,
he made it too hot to hold him. Mark can
easily tack himself on to some party of
friends, and do the tour with them. You
say that the Rothmores——”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” impatiently; “and they have
made their arrangements months ago.
Mark cannot tack himself on to people, as
you express it; it would not do at all. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
the contrary, he must have some one tacked
on to <i>him</i>. The trip will be a boon to my
brother, as well as to your nephew. Poor
Clarence loves India. He is frightfully
hard up; he would be an ideal companion
for Mark,” turning to him. “What do you
say, Mark? Answer us quite frankly.”</p>

<p>And under these circumstances what
could Mark say but, “Yes; oh, certainly.
Clarence is a good sort.”</p>

<p>“And at any rate, <i>he</i> can well be spared
from home,” added Mr. Pollitt, dryly.</p>

<p>“Then you will consent to Mark’s request,
darling?” said his wife, rising and tapping
him playfully with her big feather fan.
“Think of all he will have to tell you, and
of all the pretty things he will bring us.”</p>

<p>“As long as he does not bring a <i>wife</i>!”
growled the old gentleman. “Well, well,
well, it is not often that you and Mark are
on the same side in a debate, or that you
second the resolution. When you combine,
you are too strong for me. I’ll think it over.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pollitt gave her nephew by marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
a quick significant glance, for this speech
distinctly showed that the bill before the
(head of the) house had passed, and that
it now only remained to go into a committee
of ways and means.</p>

<p>Mark Jervis had been agreeably surprised
by his aunt’s enthusiastic co-operation;
thanks to her powerful alliance, he had
carried his point, and was to spend twelve
months travelling in India, accompanied
by Mrs. Pollitt’s brother, Captain Clarence
Waring. The latter was about to revisit
his former haunts in an entirely new
character—that of mentor and companion
to a young man—and, moreover, a wealthy
young man. All the world has heard of
“Pollitt’s Pearl Barley,” and “Pollitt’s
Patent Fowls’ Food.” Are not its merits
blazoned in flaming letters in railway
stations, in fields bordering the rocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
expresses that thunder through the land?
Does not the name of “Pollitt” greet the
miserable eyes of sea-sick travellers, as they
stagger down the companion ladders of
ocean greyhounds? In short, the enterprise
of Daniel Pollitt, and the fame of Pollitt’s
pearl barley, is of universal renown.</p>

<p>Although he has never boasted of the
fact, or assured his intimates that “he
began life with the traditional sixpence,”
Mr. Pollitt is a self-made man. He talks
freely enough of his wife’s relations, of his
nephew’s famous pedigree, but he has not
once alluded in the most distant fashion
to his own little family tree. Yet he has
nothing to be ashamed of. His father was a
gentleman by birth, a poor curate, who had
left two almost penniless orphans, Dan and
a sister, several years younger than himself.
The former, while yet in his early teens,
had clambered on to a stool in an office in
the city, from thence (unusual flight) he
had soared to success and wealth. Thanks
to indomitable industry, shrewdness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
pluck, he was now a merchant of credit and
renown. The latter, who was a remarkably
pretty and well-educated girl, accompanied
a lady to India, in the capacity of governess,
and, in a startlingly short time, married
Captain Jervis of the Bengal Cavalry, a
good-looking popular officer, with a long
pedigree and a somewhat slender purse.
By all accounts, the marriage was a happy
one. At the end of six years Mrs. Jervis
died, and their only child, a boy of five,
was sent to school in England. Five years
later, he was followed by his father, who
rushed home on three months’ leave, in
order to see little Mark as well as his tailor
and his dentist. Major Jervis, a bronzed,
handsome, distinguished soldier, made an
excellent impression on the plodding city
man—his brother-in-law, who cordially
invited him to stay with him at Norwood,
where he had a luxurious bachelor establishment.
And here, over unimpeachable claret
and cigars, the Indian officer unfolded his
plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Little Mark was about to have a stepmother,
the lady was a Miss Cardozo, of
Portuguese extraction, dark, handsome, not
very young, but enormously wealthy, and
quite infatuated about little Mark’s papa.
Her grandfather had been a military adventurer,
whose sword and swagger had gained
him the heart and treasures of a Begum.
Miss Cardozo’s father was an indigo planter,
in those good old times when indigo crops
brought in lacs of rupees, and she was his
sole heiress and an orphan. Besides the
Begum’s wealth and jewels, she owned
property in the Doon, property in the hills,
property in Tirhoot, shares in banks and
railways, and large investments in the funds.</p>

<p>Mr. Pollitt’s shrewd little eyes glistened
approvingly as he absorbed these particulars.</p>

<p>“Cut the service, bring her to England,
and take a fine country place,” was his
prompt suggestion.</p>

<p>“No, no, she hates England; she was at
school over here. She dreads our winters,
and rain and fog,” replied Major Jervis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
“And she likes my being in the service. I
can tell you that our men and horses are
something to see! Mércèdes—that is her
name—delights in pomp and show and
glitter, and is much attached to India; and
to tell you the honest truth, Pollitt, I’m
partial to the country too. I have been
out there twenty-two years, ever since I
was eighteen, with only two short furloughs,
and it’s a country that suits me down to
the ground. My near relations in England
are every one dead, I have no ties here, all
my friends and interests are out there, and
I don’t mind if I end my days in the
East.”</p>

<p>“And what about Mark?” demanded his
listener.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the question,” said his
father. “It’s hard lines on the boy, to
have no home with me—but later on he
shall go into the service, and come out to
us. You have been wonderfully kind to
him I know, having him here in his holidays,
and he is very fond of you, as he ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
be. I feel rather guilty about him, poor
chap; he is ten years old and I have seen
nothing of him for half that time, and now,
goodness knows how or where we may meet
again. Of course no money shall be spared
on his education, and all that—but——”
he paused.</p>

<p>“But <i>I’ll</i> tell you what you will do,”
continued Mr. Pollitt. “I’ll put the whole
matter in a nutshell. You are making a
fresh start, you and the boy are almost
strangers, so you won’t feel the wrench.
Give him to <i>me</i>, I am fond of him, I have
no family—he is a handsome, plucky little
fellow, with poor Lucy’s eyes—I will ensure
him a first-class education, bring him up
as my son, and make him my heir, and
leave him all I am worth; come now?”</p>

<p>“It is a splendid offer, Pollitt, but <i>I</i> am
fond of him too. I cannot provide for him
as you would, I can only set him out in
the world with a profession, and make him
a small allowance, for of course Mércèdes’
money will be settled on herself. If I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
resigned him to you, in years to come I
might repent, I might want him back.”</p>

<p>“In years to come you will probably have
half a dozen other sons, and be thankful to
have one of them off your hands.”</p>

<p>After considerable discussion—Jervis, the
father, a little reluctant; Pollitt, the uncle,
exceedingly eager and pressing—the matter
was concluded. Mark was to correspond
with his parent as regularly as he pleased,
but he was to be, to all intents and purposes,
his uncle Daniel’s son.</p>

<p>Major Jervis made the most of his five
weeks in England. He invested in a new
and gorgeous uniform, a new battery of
guns, saddlery, presents for Indian friends
and his <i>fiancée</i>, and saw as much as possible
of Mark. The more the pair were acquainted
the better they liked each other.
They went to the Tower, Madame Tussaud’s,
the Zoo, the theatres. Mark invariably accompanied
his parent to tailors, boot-makers
and gun-smiths, and became subsequently
quite the authority on these matters at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
school. His soldierly, open-handed sire,
who loaded him with gifts, who told him
tales of the stirring deeds of his ancestors,
of his own swarthy sowars, of tiger-hunting
and elephant drives, speedily became his
hero and his idol.</p>

<p>On being sounded as to his own choice
of a profession, Mark, after taking thought
for a considerable time, gravely announced
to his father and uncle, “that he would
prefer to be a bachelor.”</p>

<p>“And by no means a bad choice,” roared
Mr. Pollitt, in great glee. “Stick to that,
my boy, stick to that, copy your old
uncle.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he will,” remarked Major
Jervis, with decision; “he will take after
me. We are a susceptible race, we Jervises,
and I’ll give him till he is two and twenty.”</p>

<p>The day of parting was a dismal one for
father and son. The child struggled desperately
to be a man, to shed no tears, and
bore himself wonderfully, at any rate in
public, but after the cab had driven off, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
rushed away and shut himself up in his own
little bedroom, and flung himself upon the
floor, and abandoned himself to the bitterest
grief he had ever experienced, and he was
ten years old.</p>

<p>Some years after this scene, Mr. Pollitt,
to every one’s surprise, married a faded,
elegant-looking woman, of good family, but
portionless. He bought a house in Princes
Gate, rented a grouse moor, deer forest,
and hunting box, and invested in some
celebrated diamonds. He had now amassed
a great fortune, and at the age of fifty-five,
retired from business, in order to spend it.
But here arose an unexpected difficulty, he
did not know how to enjoy the result of his
labours, save by proxy. He looked up to
his handsome well-born nephew to manipulate
his thousands, much as a child
appeals to an experienced friend to work
a new mechanical toy. All his own youth
had been spent among great city warehouses,
on wharves, and in offices. He had never
ridden, save on the top of an omnibus, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
could not drive, shoot, row, or even fish,
and, alas! it was now too late to learn. He,
however, took to field sports in the character
of a spectator, with surprising enthusiasm.
He walked with the guns on his moors, and
was much excited respecting the bag. He
gave fancy prices for his nephew’s hunters,
and attended every meet (on wheels), where
there was a prospect of seeing their performance,
following the line, and keeping
the hounds in sight as far as possible, by
means of short cuts and glasses.</p>

<p>He was a truly proud man when he saw
his nephew’s name in the <i>Field</i> as foremost
rider in a sensational run. The worst of
it was, that Mark hated notoriety of any
kind, hung back where he should come
forward, came forward when he should have
hung back; had actually no desire to lease
a theatre, keep race-horses, or even gamble;
in short, he had not a single extravagant
taste. (Here, indeed, was a most singular
case. How many fathers are there in these
latter days who feel hurt and disappointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
because their sons will not spend thousands?)
On the other hand, Mrs. Pollitt was only
too ready to assist her partner in laying out
large sums. She had many needy connections,
and hoped to do great things for
them; but she found, to her deep chagrin,
that the personal spending of her husband’s
wealth was denied her. She had a liberal
dress allowance, diamonds of the first water,
equipages, a fine establishment, a French
maid; but she might not thrust her hand
into her lord and master’s purse and scatter
largesse to her poor relations, and—what
was a truly hard case—she might not even
attempt to arrange an alliance between
Mark and one of her nieces. No, Mr.
Pollitt was resolved that his heir should
marry <i>rank</i>. It must be “Mr. and Lady
Somebody Jervis,” and with Mark’s good
looks, money, and birth, there would be no
difficulty in this little matter. Then Mark
must go into Parliament, settle down as
a great landed proprietor, and ruffle it with
the best. Thus was his future sketched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
out by his uncle, who wisely kept the sketch
to himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pollitt was surprised to find her
dear Daniel so obstinate and impracticable
on several trifling matters. For instance,
she had made up her mind to change the
spelling of his name, and had even gone so
far as to have her own cards printed, “Mrs.
D. Murray-Paulet, 500, Princes Gate.”</p>

<p>“How lucky that Daniel has a second
name!” she said to herself as she complacently
examined her new title a few
days after her marriage. She tripped
across the room and held a card playfully
before the bridegroom’s spectacles, and the
tiresome man had exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Who is she? I can’t stand visitors.
Here, let me clear out first, if she is coming
up——”</p>

<p>“The new card trick,” as he subsequently
called it, had been their first trial
of strength, and the bride had succumbed
with tears.</p>

<p>“Change his name!” he had roared—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
“his name, that he had made! Never!
He was proud of it. It was the wife who
changed her name on marriage, not the
husband. Was she aware of that?”</p>

<p>Another subject on which she had had to
yield was the housekeeping bills; they all
passed through Mr. Pollitt’s hands, who
settled them by cheque, consequently there
were no pickings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pollitt had her own particular
schemes; she could not offer her kinsfolk
much solid assistance, but did what she
could. To her sister and nieces she distributed
dresses and mantles scarcely
worn; she gave them drives, boxes at the
theatre, tickets, and perpetual invitations
to dinner, lunch, and all her parties; to
her brother Clarence such sums as she
could spare from her pin-money. Clarence
was ten years her junior, gay, <i>débonnaire</i>,
and good-looking. He had a pair of handsome,
insolent blue eyes, a well-cultivated
moustache, an admirable figure, and a
rather overbearing manner. He was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
complete man of the world, who had many
pecuniary troubles, no fixed principles, and
but few scruples. He was, nevertheless,
pleasant, and by no means unpopular.</p>

<p>Captain Waring had spent every penny
that he possessed (and a good many
pennies belonging to other people); and
when his regiment came home from India,
he had been compelled to retire from the
service, and had been living ever since on
his friends and his wits. This Indian trip
would be a capital thing for him, all expenses
paid; and if he and Mark remained
away a year, some of the other connections
might get a footing at Princes Gate. The
aphorism, “Absence makes the heart grow
fonder,” does not apply to uncles and
nephews.</p>

<p>If Mark were <i>never</i> to return, it would
not break his aunt’s heart. If he had not
been her husband’s favourite, she might
have been fond of him. He was exceedingly
presentable; she liked to exhibit him
in her carriage or opera-box (a gratification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
she seldom enjoyed). He was always
polite, always thoughtful of her comfort,
always respectful, though he had shown
himself ready with a forcible reply on one
or two critical occasions; but he did not
understand the art of administering flattery,
and she consumed it in large doses. Now
here Clarence was supreme; it was <i>he</i> who
had solemnly assured her that she bore a
striking resemblance to Sara Bernhardt.
Yes, golden voice and all; and the poor
deluded lady believed him, and attired
herself in clinging draperies, and combed
her fringe well over her brows in order to
emphasize her undeniable resemblance to
the great actress. Once, when she questioned
Mr. Pollitt on the subject, he had laughed
so uproariously—so like a husband—that
an apoplectic seizure seemed imminent.</p>

<p>Captain Waring was most enthusiastic
respecting this Indian scheme, and naturally
gave the project his warmest support.
<i>Tête-à-tête</i>, he said, “It’s a first-class
notion of Mark’s. The uncle keeps him far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
too tight in hand. No wonder he wants to
break away and see the world and live his
own life, poor devil!”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” protested Mrs.
Pollitt, irritably. “He has plenty of
liberty and a latch-key.”</p>

<p>“And does not know how to use one or
other. Besides, the uncle’s proud eye is
always on him; he follows him about like
a dog—worse, for dogs are not admitted
into clubs! However, this twelve months’
holiday in a far country will be a most
blessed relief to the boy and A1 business
for me. I’m on my last legs; and if this
had not turned up, I’d have had to make
strong running with Miss Clodde. She is
common and repulsive looking, but has
thirty thousand pounds. I hope I may
never be so <i>desperate</i> as to marry her—at
any rate, I have a year’s respite.”</p>

<p>“How do you know she would have you,
Clar?”</p>

<p>Clar’s laugh was an interesting study in
manly assurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“I really wish you <i>were</i> married,” continued
his sister rather peevishly.</p>

<p>“Yes; to a rich elderly widow who has
had her fling—that is my style.”</p>

<p>“What a horrible way of talking! You
are really too dreadful. I suppose this trip
will be rather costly?”</p>

<p>“Ra—<i>ther</i>!” emphatically.</p>

<p>“And you will be the treasurer?” opening
her pale eyes to their widest extent.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” shaking his
head. “Of course, as I am the manager,
and am personally conducting this tour, all
payments ought to come from <i>me</i>. ‘The
uncle,’ however, is rather shy of having
monetary dealings with his brother-in-law,
as you know by sad experience. However,
I may be able to work it, once we are in
India, and you may depend upon me for
making the most of my time and—opportunities.
I was so hard up, I was thinking
of taking a leaf out of Charlie Wilde’s
book. He writes hymns and tracts——”</p>

<p>“How absurd you are! What preposterous nonsense!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
Charlie Wilde, who has
never entered a place of worship for years,
write tracts!”</p>

<p>“I tell you that he does!” persisted
Clarence. “He has a wonderful knack,
and does the pathetic and emotional style
A1. Gets about ten pounds apiece, and
invests the money in a flutter on the turf.”</p>

<p>“Well, Clar,” said his deeply shocked
sister, “I cannot compliment you on your
companions; and, whatever you may come
to, I hope you will never arrive at such a
pitch of wickedness as that.”</p>

<p>On one point Captain Waring and Mr.
Pollitt were most warmly agreed, viz. that
“the trip must be done in good style if
done at all.”</p>

<p>Mark was inclined to travel “on the
cheap,” his uncle had complained, and had
protested against a large quantity of baggage,
a battery of guns, and a valet.</p>

<p>“Thirty pair of boots!” he cried.
“What rubbish! I am not going to <i>walk</i>
round India!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“But Clarence says you can’t do with
less, and he must know better than you
do,” argued Mr. Pollitt. “I wish you to
travel like a gentleman, not like a bag-man.
There is where you disappoint me, my boy—you
make no show, no dash; your tastes
are all for quiet—your favourite character
is the violet, and you prefer a back seat.
You are going out in the same steamer
with a lot of nobs—I’ve seen to that—and
it is as likely as not that you will join
forces when you land. These swells take
to you. As for me, they only take to my
dinners, and my deer forest. However, as
long as <i>you</i> are in the best set, I don’t
care—I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>“I think Clarence and I will stick to
ourselves, and not join any party, sir; we
will be more independent. He has sketched
out our beat—Bombay, Poonah, Secunderabad,
Travancore, Madras, Ceylon, Calcutta,
the hills; and that puts me in mind to ask
if you have any idea of my father’s whereabouts?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“Bostock and Bell, Bombay, are his
agents,” evading the question and his
nephew’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I know that; I have written to their
care steadily for the last six years.”</p>

<p>“And never had an answer?” with ill-concealed
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“No, except a ‘Pioneer’ at long, long
intervals.”</p>

<p>“Just to show that he is alive? Let me
see, it is eight years since he left the service
and went to live at a place called the
Doon. He wrote pretty regularly up to
then; and when Mrs. Jervis was killed in
that carriage accident, he never sent a line,
only a paper. Poor woman! I believe she
led him a devil of a life. She was insanely
jealous.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I can get his address in
Bombay—his real address, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think so.”</p>

<p>“And then I shall look him up—at
once.”</p>

<p>“If he will be looked up. The Jervises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
are an eccentric family. I heard some
queer stories of them not long ago.”</p>

<p>“But my father never struck you as
eccentric, did he?”</p>

<p>“No. And, of course, you must try and
see him; but don’t let him lay hands on
you and <i>keep</i> you, my boy. He was a
handsome, persuasive sort of fellow, and
had wonderful personal charm—when he
chose to exert it. India has cast a spell
upon him, and kept him with her for the
best part of his life. Don’t let India do
the same by <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry now you are going out
there, for several reasons. I would have
preferred China or Australia, but Waring
has his say and his way.”</p>

<p>“And I had <i>my</i> say and my way too,
Uncle Dan. India is my native land; I
remember it distinctly—the servants with
their dark faces and big white turbans, my
little chestnut pony, which was called the
‘Lal Tatoo,’ and I want to see my father.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
You know we have not met for fifteen
years.”</p>

<p>“I know,” assented Mr. Pollitt, gloomily,
and added, after a pause, “I wonder now,
if it would be possible for you to throw
me over—and stop out there with him!”</p>

<p>“There is not the smallest probability of
that. Besides, my father does not want me.”</p>

<p>“And supposing that he <i>did</i>!” exclaimed
Mr. Pollitt, suddenly jumping up and beginning
to walk about the room. “Bear
this in view, that you must make up your
mind between us! You cannot be son and
heir to <i>two</i> men! You can pay him a visit
of a week, or at most a month; but if you
postpone coming home at his request—I
warn you, that you may stay in India till
I fetch you! To put the matter in a nutshell,
I wash my hands of you for ever!
Not one farthing of my money will you
see,” he continued, speaking in great excitement.
“I shall leave every shilling to
hospitals, you understand that, eh?” he
gasped, breathless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and it would be but just. I cannot
live with my father in India and be your
adopted son at home, but you are needlessly
alarmed. I shall turn up again within a
year without fail. I’ll take a return ticket
if you like.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a bargain, my boy. I’m a
bit jealous of your father, and it’s a nasty,
low, ungentlemanly feeling. I must confess
that I have been glad that he, so to
speak, dropped you. But he handed you
over to me when he married the Begum,
and you are <i>my</i> son—not his.”</p>

<p>The day of departure arrived; the valet
(a somewhat garrulous person, with superb
references), in charge of three cabs loaded
with baggage, preceded the travellers to
Victoria, whilst Mr. and Mrs. Pollitt drove
the young men in the family landau, in
order to see the last of them.</p>

<p>As Mark and his uncle slowly paced the
platform, the latter, who had been incessantly
fussy all the morning, said—</p>

<p>“Now, I hope nothing has been forgotten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
and that you have everything you
want?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we have—and ten times over.”</p>

<p>“You will write often—once a week—if
only a line, eh? Mind you don’t forget us.”</p>

<p>“No fear of that, Uncle Dan.”</p>

<p>“And remember our bargain. Though
I have not taken return tickets, after all.
Don’t stay longer than the year. I don’t
know how I’m to get on without you. I
can never use the mail-phaeton now, for
I hate sitting beside the coachman—and—you
know, I tried to drive once—and the
result. There will be no one to take me
on the river on a hot afternoon—other
people but you think an old fogey has no
business there. Oh, I shall miss you! I’ve
lodged money for you in Bombay with
Bostock &amp; Bell’s” (naming a magnificent
sum), “and when it’s done, you must come
home, for I won’t send you another stiver.
It’s in your name, of course—you will be
paymaster.”</p>

<p>“All right, uncle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Keep your cheque-book locked up.
Don’t let a tiger get hold of you, or one of
those scheming, husband-hunting women
that Clarence talks about.”</p>

<p>“You may make your mind quite easy
on that score,” with a rather derisive
smile.</p>

<p>“Well, time is up, my dear boy. I am
sorry you are going; take care of yourself.
God bless you!” wringing his hand as he
spoke.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Pollitt and her brother
had also been having a few parting words.</p>

<p>“Now, Clar,” she said impressively, “I
have done a good thing for you. This is a
splendid chance. Be sure you make the
most of it; if you please the ‘uncle,’ as
you call him, he will help you to something
better by-and-by.”</p>

<p>Clarence nodded sagaciously. He was in
the highest spirits.</p>

<p>“You are not really limited to time, you
know,” she continued, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I know,” and there was a significant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
look in his right eye, almost approaching
to a wink.</p>

<p>“And you will be manager—and paymaster.”</p>

<p>“Guide, councillor, and friend, you <i>bet</i>.”</p>

<p>“And now, dear boy, <i>do</i> be prudent; don’t
get into any more entanglements with grass
widows; don’t get into any more betting or
gambling scrapes—promise me.”</p>

<p>“I shall be as steady as old Time or
young Mark himself, and I can’t say more.
Well, good-bye—and thanks awfully, Lina.
I must say you <i>do</i> stick to your own people”—adding,
with a hasty kiss—“I see we are
off.”</p>

<p>As the carriage moved slowly past the
Pollitts, who were standing side by side,
Clarence flung himself back with a boisterous
laugh, as he exclaimed—</p>

<p>“I declare, the uncle seems quite cut up—ha,
ha, ha! Upon my soul, I believe the
old chap is <i>crying</i>!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br><span class="small">MAJOR BYNG’S SUGGESTION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Major Byng, a wiry, dried-up little officer,
with remarkably thin legs and sporting proclivities,
was reclining in a long chair, in
the verandah of the Napier Hotel, Poonah,
smoking his after-breakfast “Trichy,” and
running his eye over the “Asian” pocket-book.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Byng, old man!” cried a loud
cheerful voice, and looking up, his amaze
was depicted in the countenance he turned
upon Clarence Waring.</p>

<p>“Waring! Why—I thought,” putting
down his book and sitting erect.</p>

<p>“Thought I had gone home—sold out
and was stone broke. But here I am, you
see, on my legs again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“Delighted to hear it,” with a swift
glance at Waring’s well-to-do air and expensive-looking
clothes. “Sit down, my
dear boy,” he cried cordially, “sit down
and have a cheroot, and tell me all about
yourself and what has brought you back
again to the land of regrets? Is it tea,
coffee, or gold?”</p>

<p>“Gold, in one sense. I am companion
to a young millionaire, or rather to the
nephew of a man who has so much money—and
<i>no</i> children—that he does not know
what to do.”</p>

<p>“And who is the young man? Does <i>he</i>
know what to do?”</p>

<p>“His name is Jervis—his rich uncle is
married to my sister; we are connections,
you see, and when he expressed a desire
to explore the gorgeous East, my sister
naturally suggested <i>me</i> for the post of
guide, philosopher, and friend.”</p>

<p>Here Major Byng gave a short sharp
laugh, like a bark.</p>

<p>“We landed in Bombay ten days ago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
and are going to tour about and see the
world.”</p>

<p>“What is the programme?”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> programme is as follows: Poonah
races, Secunderabad races, Madras races, a
big game shoot in Travancore, expense no
object, elephants, beaters, club-cook, coolies
with letters, and ice for the champagne.
Then I shall run him about in the train a
bit, and show him Delhi, Agra, Jeypore;
after that we will put in the end of the cold
weather in Calcutta. I have lots of pals
there, and from Calcutta we will go to the
hills, to Shirani. I shall be glad to see
the old club again—many a fleeting hour
have I spent there!”</p>

<p>“That same club had a shocking bad
name for gambling and bear fighting,” said
Major Byng significantly.</p>

<p>“I believe it had, now you mention it;
but you may be sure that it has reformed—like
myself.”</p>

<p>“And this young fellow—what is he
like?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“Quiet, gentlemanly, easy-going, easily
pleased, thinks every one a good sort,” and
Waring laughed derisively; “abhors all
fuss or show, never bets, never gets up in the
morning with a head, no expensive tastes.”</p>

<p>“In fact, his tastes are miserably beneath
his opportunities! What a pity it is that
the millionaire is not <i>your</i> uncle!”</p>

<p>“Yes, instead of merely brother-in-law,
and brothers-in-law are notoriously unfeeling.
However, I have adopted mine as my
own blood relation, for the present. <i>I</i> boss
the show. Come and dine with me to-night,
and tell me all the ‘gup,’ and give me
the straight tip for the Arab purse.”</p>

<p>“All right. Is this young Jervis a
sportsman?”</p>

<p>“He is a first-class man on a horse, and
he plays polo, but he does not go in for
racing—more’s the pity!”</p>

<p>“Plays polo, does he? By Jove!” and
an eager light shone in the major’s little
greenish eyes. “I’ve a couple of ponies
for sale——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“He does not want them now, whatever
he may do later in Calcutta or in the hills.
I shall be looking out for three or four for
myself, good sound ones, mind you, Byng,
up to weight. I’ve put on flesh, you see,
but I dare say my anxious responsibilities
will wear me down a bit. Jervis does not
weigh more than ten stone, and, talk of the
devil, here he comes.”</p>

<p>Major Byng turned his head quickly, as
at this moment Waring’s travelling companion,
a slight, active-looking young man,
entered the compound, closely pursued by a
swarm of hawkers, and their accompanying
train of coolies, bearing on their heads the
inevitable Poonah figures, hand-screens,
pottery, beetle-work, silks, silver, and
jewellery.</p>

<p>“I say, Waring,” he called out as he
approached, “just look at me! One would
think I was a queen bee. If this goes
on, you will have to consign me to a
lunatic asylum, if there is such a place out
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Mark, let me introduce you to my old
friend, Major Byng.”</p>

<p>Major Byng bent forward in his chair—to
stand up was too great an exertion even
to greet a possible purchaser of polo ponies—smiled
affably, and said—</p>

<p>“You are only just out, I understand.
How do you like India?”</p>

<p>“So far, I loathe it,” sitting down as he
spoke, removing his topee, and wiping his
forehead. “Ever since I landed, I have
lived in a state of torment.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the mosquitoes!” exclaimed Major
Byng, sympathetically; “you will get used
to them. They always make for new arrivals
and fresh blood.”</p>

<p>“No, no; but human mosquitoes! Touts,
hawkers, beggars, jewellers, horse-dealers.
They all set upon me from the moment I
arrived. Ever since then, my life is a
burthen to me. It was pretty bad on board
ship. Some of our fellow-travellers seemed
to think I was a great celebrity, instead of
the common or ordinary passenger; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
loaded me with civil speeches, and the day
we got into Bombay I was nearly buried
alive in invitations, people were <i>so</i> sorry to
part with me!”</p>

<p>“Here is a nice young cynic for you!”
exclaimed Captain Waring, complacently.
“He is not yet accustomed to the fierce
light that beats upon a good-looking
young bachelor, <i>heir</i> to thirty thousand a
year——”</p>

<p>“Why not make it a hundred thousand at
once, while you are about it?” interrupted
the other impatiently. “How could they
tell I was <i>heir</i> to any one? I’m sure I am
a most everyday-looking individual. My
uncle’s income is not ticketed on my
back!”</p>

<p>“It was in one sense,” exclaimed Waring,
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“It was only with the common, vulgar
class that I was so immensely popular.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you are much too
humble minded. You were popular with
every one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“No, by no means; I could have hugged
the supercilious old dame who asked me
with a drawl if I was in any way related to
Pollitt’s patent fowl food? I was delighted
to answer with effusion, ‘Nephew, ma’am.’
<i>She</i> despised me from the very bottom of
her soul, and made no foolish effort to
conceal her feelings.”</p>

<p>“Ah! She had no <i>daughters</i>,” rejoined
Waring, with a scornful laugh. “The valet
told all about you. He had nothing on
earth to do, but magnify his master and
consequently exalt himself. Your value is
reflected in your gentleman’s gentleman,
and he had no mock modesty, and priced
you at a cool million! By the way, I saw
him driving off just now in the best hotel
landau, with his feet on the opposite
cushions, and a cigarette in his mouth.
He is a magnificent advertisement.”</p>

<p>They were now the centre of a vast mob
of hawkers, who formed a squatting circle,
and the verandah was fully stocked. The
jewellers had already untied their nice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
little tin boxes from their white calico
wrappers, and their contents were displayed
on the usual enticing squares of red saloo.</p>

<p>“Waring Sahib!” screamed an ancient
vendor with but one eye. “Last time,
three four years ago, I see you at Charleville
Hotel, Mussouri, I sell your honour one
very nice diamond bangle for one pretty
lady——”</p>

<p>“Well, Crackett, I’m not such a fool
now. I want a neat pearl pin for myself.”
He proceeded to deliberately select one
from a case, and then added with a grin,
“That time, <i>I</i> paying for lady; <i>this</i> time,
gentleman,” pointing to Jervis, “paying
for <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stand it,” cried Jervis, jumping
to his feet. “Here is the man with the
chestnut Arab and the spotted cob with
pink legs, that has been persecuting me for
two days; and here comes the boy with the
stuffed peacock who has stalked me all
morning; and—I see the girl in the thunder
and lightning waistcoat. I know she is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
going to ask me to ride with her,” and he
snatched up his topee and fled.</p>

<p>Major Byng noticed Jervis at the <i>table
d’hôte</i> that evening. He had been cleverly
“cut off” from Waring, and was the prey
of two over-dressed, noisy young women.
Mrs. Pollitt was mistaken, second-rate
people <i>did</i> come to India.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, Waring!” he said to
that gentleman, who was in his most jovial,
genial humour, “that young fellow is most
shamefully mobbed. His valet has given
him away. If you don’t look out, he will
slip his heel ropes and bolt home. Pray
observe his expression! Just look at those
two women, especially at the one who is
measuring the size of her waist with her
<i>serviette</i>, for his information. He will go
back by the next steamer; it is written on
his forehead!”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t do that,” rejoined Clarence,
with lazy confidence. “He has a most
particular reason for staying out here for a
while; but I grant you that he is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
enjoying himself, and does not appear to
appreciate seeing the world—and it is not
a bad old world if you know the right way
to take it. Now, if <i>I</i> were in his shoes,”
glancing expressively across the table, “I’d
fool that young woman to the very top of
her bent!”</p>

<p>In the billiard-room, when Mark joined
them, Major Byng said—</p>

<p>“I saw your dismal plight at dinner,
and pitied you. If you want to lead a
quiet life, and will take an old soldier’s
advice, I would say, get rid of the valet,
send him home with half your luggage.
Then start from a fresh place, where no
one knows you, with a good Mussulman
bearer, who is a complete stranger to
your affairs. Let Clarence here be paymaster—<i>he</i>
can talk the language, and
looks wealthy and important—he won’t
mind bearing the brunt, or being taken for
a rich man if the trouble breaks out again,
and you can live in peace and gang your
ain gait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>The Major’s advice was subsequently
acted upon,—with most excellent results.
The cousins meanwhile attended the Poonah
races, where Clarence met some old
acquaintances.</p>

<p>One of them privately remarked to Major
Byng—</p>

<p>“Waring seems to have nine lives, like a
cat, and looks most festive and prosperous.
I saw him doing a capital ready-money
business with the ‘Bookies’ just now—and
he is a good customer to the Para Mutual.
It is a little startling to see <i>him</i> in the
character of mentor. I only hope he won’t
get into <i>many</i> scrapes!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Telemachus has his head screwed
on pretty tight, and he will look after
Waring—the pupil will take care of the
teacher. He is a real good sort, that
boy. I wonder if his people know
how old Clarence used to race, and
carry on and gamble at the lotteries, and
generally play the devil when he was out
here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“Not they!” emphatically.</p>

<p>“He owes me one hundred rupees this
three years, but he is such a tremendous
Bahadur now, that I am ashamed to remind
him of such a trifling sum. I sincerely
hope that he has turned over a new leaf
and is a reformed character. What do you
say, Crompton?”</p>

<p>“I say ‘Amen,’ with all my heart,” was
the prompt response.</p>

<p>Mark Jervis had gone straight to the
agents, Bostock &amp; Bell’s, the day he had
landed in Bombay, and asked for his father’s
address. He only obtained it with difficulty
and after considerable delay. The head of
the firm, in a private interview, earnestly
entreated him to keep the secret, otherwise
they would get into trouble, as Major Jervis
was a <i>peculiar</i> man and most mysterious
about his affairs, which were now entirely
managed by a Mr. Cardozo. Major Jervis
had not corresponded with them personally,
for years. He then scribbled something on
a card, which he handed to the new arrival,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
who eagerly read, “Mr. Jones, Hawal-Ghât,
via Shirani, N.W.P.” The major’s
son despatched a letter with this superscription
by the very next post.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br><span class="small">A RESERVED LADY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A hot moonless night towards the end of
March, and the up-mail from Bombay to
Calcutta has come to a standstill. The
glare from the furnace and the carriage
lamps lights up the ghostly looking telegraph-posts,
the dusty cactus hedge, and
illuminates a small portion of the surrounding
jungle. Anxiously gazing eyes see no
sign of a station, or even of a signalman’s
hut, within the immediate glare—and
beyond it there looms a rocky, barren
tract, chiefly swallowed up in inscrutable
darkness.</p>

<p>There is a babel of men’s voices, shrill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and emotional, and not emanating from
European throats, a running of many feet,
and above all is heard the snorting of the
engine and the dismal shrieks of the steam
whistle.</p>

<p>“What does it all mean?” inquired a
silvery treble, and a fluffy head leant out
of a first-class ladies’ compartment.</p>

<p>“Nothing to be alarmed about,” responded
a pleasant tenor voice from the permanent
way. “There has been a collision between
two goods trains about a mile ahead, and
the line is blocked.”</p>

<p>“Any one killed?” she drawled.</p>

<p>“Only a couple of niggers,” rejoined the
pleasant voice, in a cheerful key.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed the lady with
sudden animation; “why, Captain Waring,
surely it cannot be you!”</p>

<p>“Pray why not?” now climbing up on
the foot-board. “And do I behold Mrs.
Bellett?” as the head and shoulders of
a good-looking man appeared at the window,
and looked into the carriage, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
contained a mountain of luggage, two
ladies, a monkey, and a small green parrot.</p>

<p>“Where have you dropped from?” she
inquired. “I thought you had left India
for ever and ever. What has brought you
back?”</p>

<p>“The remembrance of happier days,” he
answered, with a sentimental air, “and a
P. and O. steamer.”</p>

<p>“But you have left the service, surely?”</p>

<p>“Yes, three years ago; it was too much
of a grind at home. Formerly I was in
India on duty, now I am out here for
pleasure. No bother about over-staying
my leave—no fear of brass hats.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, is there any fear of our
being run into by another train?” inquired
the second lady nervously, a lady who sat
at the opposite side of the compartment
with her head muffled up in a pink shawl.</p>

<p>“Not the smallest; we are perfectly
safe.”</p>

<p>“Captain Waring, this is my sister, Mrs.
Coote,” explained Mrs. Bellett. “And now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
perhaps you can tell us where we are, and
what is to become of us?”</p>

<p>“As to where you are, you are about
three miles from Okara Junction; as to
what will happen to you, I am afraid that
you will have to walk there under my
escort—if I may be permitted that honour.”</p>

<p>“Walk three miles!” she repeated
shrilly. “Why, I have not done such a
thing for years, and I have on thin shoes.
Could we not go on the engine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if the engine could fly over nearly
a hundred luggage waggons. It is a fine
starlight night; we will get a lamp, and
can keep along the line. They have sent
for a break-down gang, and we shall catch
another train at Okara. We will only have
about an hour or two to wait.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we must make the best
of it!” said Mrs. Coote, “like others,”
as numbers of natives flocked past, chattering
volubly, and carrying their bedding
and bundles.</p>

<p>“I wish we could get supper at Okara,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
said her sister. “I am sure we shall want
it after our tramp; but I know we need
not build on anything better than a goat
chop, and the day before yesterday’s curry.
However, I have a tea-basket.”</p>

<p>“I can go one better,” said Captain
Waring. “I have a tiffin-basket, well
supplied with ice, champagne, cold tongue,
potted grouse—cake—fruit——”</p>

<p>“You are making me quite ravenous,”
cried Mrs. Bellett. “But how are you to
get all these delicacies to Okara?”</p>

<p>“By a coolie, I hope. If the worst comes
to the worst, I will carry them on my head,
sooner than leave them behind. However,
rupees work wonders, and I expect I shall
get hold of as many as will carry the basket,
and also your baggage; I suppose fifty will
do?” and with a grin, he climbed down
out of sight.</p>

<p>“What a stroke of luck, Nettie!”
exclaimed Mrs. Bellett. “He used to be
such a friend of mine at Mussouri, and
imagine coming across him in this way!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
He seems to be rolling in money; he must
have come in for a fortune, for he used to
be frightfully hard up. I’m so glad to
meet him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s all very fine for <i>you</i>, who are
dressed,” rejoined the other in a peevish
voice; “but just look at me in an old tea-jacket,
with my hair in curling-pins!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you were all right! I’m certain he
never noticed you!” was the sisterly reply.
“Let us be quick and put up our things.
I wish to goodness the ayah was here,” and
she began to bustle about, and strap up
wraps and pillows, and collect books and
fans.</p>

<p>Every one in the train seemed to be in a
state of activity, preparing for departure,
and presently many parties on foot, with
lanterns, might be seen streaming along
the line. Captain Waring promptly returned
with a dozen coolies, and soon Mrs.
Bellett’s carriage was empty. She and her
sister were assisted by Captain Waring and
a young man—presumably his companion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Ere descending, Mrs. Bellett, who had a
pretty foot, paused on the step to exhibit
the thinness of her shoes, and demanded,
as she put out her Louis-Quatorze sole,
“how she was to walk three miles in <i>that</i>,
along a rough road?”</p>

<p>The two ladies were nevertheless in the
highest spirits, and appeared to enjoy the
novelty of the adventure. Ere the quartette
had gone twenty yards, the guard
came shouting after them—</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” to Captain Waring,
“but there is a lady quite alone in my
charge. I can’t take her on; I must stay
and see to the baggage, and remain here.
And would you look after her?”</p>

<p>“Where is she?” demanded Waring,
irritably.</p>

<p>“Last carriage but one—reserved ladies,
first-class.”</p>

<p>“I say, Mark,” turning to his friend,
“if she is a reserved lady, you are all right.
He is awfully shy, this young fellow,” he
explained to his other companions, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
loud laugh. “I don’t mind betting that
she is old—and you know you are fond of
old women—so just run back like a good
chap. You see, I have Mrs. Bellett and
her sister—you won’t be five minutes
behind us, bring on the reserved lady as
fast as you can.”</p>

<p>The other made no audible reply, but
obediently turned about, and went slowly
past the rows of empty carriages until he
came nearly to the end of the train. Here
he discovered a solitary white figure standing
above him in the open door of a compartment,
and a girlish voice called down
into the dark—</p>

<p>“Is that you, guard?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer; “but the guard
has sent me to ask if I can help you in any
way.”</p>

<p>A momentary pause, and then there came
a rather doubtful “Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Your lamp has gone out, I see, but I
can easily strike a match and get your
things together. There is a block on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
line, and you will have to get down and
walk on to the next station.”</p>

<p>“Really? Has there been an accident?
I could not make out what the people were
saying.”</p>

<p>“It is not of much consequence—two
goods trains disputing the right of way; but
we shall have to walk to Okara to catch
the Cawnpore mail.”</p>

<p>“Is it far?”</p>

<p>“About three miles, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is not much! I have not
many things—only a dressing-bag, a rug,
and a parasol.”</p>

<p>“All right; if you will pass them down,
I will carry them.”</p>

<p>“But surely there is a porter,” expostulated
the lady, “and I need not trouble
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there is what <i>you</i> call
a porter nearer than Brindisi, and all the
coolies are taking out the luggage. Allow
me to help you.”</p>

<p>In another second the young lady, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
was both light and active, stood beside him
on the line. She was English; she was
tall; and she wore a hideously shaped
country-made topee—that was all that he
could make out in the dim light.</p>

<p>“Now, shall we start?” he asked briskly,
taking her bag, rug, and parasol.</p>

<p>“Please let me have the bag,” she entreated.
“I—I—that is to say, I would
rather keep it myself. All my money is
in it.”</p>

<p>“And I may be a highwayman for what
you know,” he returned, with a laugh. “I
give you my word of honour that, if you
will allow me to carry it, I will not rob you.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean that,” she stammered.</p>

<p>“Then what did you mean? At any
rate <i>I</i> mean to keep it. The other passengers
are on ahead—I suppose you are
quite alone?”</p>

<p>“Almost. There is a servant in the
train who is supposed to look after me, but
I am looking after him, and seeing that he
is not left behind at the different junctions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
We cannot understand one word we exchange,
so he grins and gesticulates, and I
nod and point; but it all comes to nothing,
or worse than nothing. I wanted some tea
this morning, and he brought me whisky
and soda.”</p>

<p>“And have you no one to rely on but
this intelligent attendant?”</p>

<p>“No. The people I came out with
changed at Khandala, and left me in charge
of the guard, and in a through carriage to
Allahabad; and of course we never expected
this.”</p>

<p>“So you have just come out from
home?” he observed, as they walked along
at a good pace.</p>

<p>“Yes; arrived yesterday morning in the
<i>Arcadia</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then this is the first time you have
actually set foot on Indian soil, for trains
and gharries do not count?”</p>

<p>“It is. Are there”—looking nervously
at the wild expanse on either hand—“any
tigers about, do you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“No, I sincerely hope not, as I have no
weapon but your parasol. Joking apart,
you are perfectly safe. This”—with a
wave of the aforesaid parasol—“is not
their style of hunting-ground.”</p>

<p>“And what is their style, as you call
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lots of high grass and jungle, in a
cattle country.”</p>

<p>“Have you shot many tigers?”</p>

<p>“Two last month. My friend and I had
rather good sport down in Travancore.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you live out here?”</p>

<p>“No, I have only been about six months
in the country.”</p>

<p>“I wish <i>I</i> had been six months in India.”</p>

<p>“May I ask why?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you may. Because I would
be going home in six months more.”</p>

<p>“And you only landed forty-eight hours
ago! Surely you are not tired of it already.
I thought all young ladies liked India.
Mind where you are going! It is very dark
here. Will you take hold of my arm?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“No, thank you,” rather stiffly.</p>

<p>“Then my hand? You really had better,
or you will come a most awful cropper, and
trip over the sleepers.”</p>

<p>“Here is an extraordinary adventure!”
said Honor to herself. “What would
Jessie and Fairy say, if they could see me
now, walking along in the dark through a
wild desolate country, hand-in-hand with
an absolutely strange young man, whose
face I have never even seen?”</p>

<p>A short distance ahead were groups of
chattering natives—women with red dresses
and brass lotahs, which caught the light of
their hand-lanterns (a lantern is to a native
what an umbrella is to a Briton); turbaned,
long-legged men, who carried bundles,
lamps, and sticks. The line was bordered
on either hand by thick hedges of greyish
cactus; here and there glimmered a white
flower; here and there an ancient bush
showed bare distorted roots, like the ribs
of some defunct animal. Beyond stretched
a dim mysterious landscape, which looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
weird and ghostly by the light of a few pale
stars. The night was still and oppressively
warm.</p>

<p>“You will be met at Allahabad, I suppose?”
observed Honor’s unknown escort,
after a considerable silence.</p>

<p>“Yes—by my aunt.”</p>

<p>“You must be looking forward to seeing
her again?”</p>

<p>“<i>Again!</i> I have never seen her as yet.”
She paused, and then continued, “We
are three girls at home, and my aunt and
uncle wished to have one of us on a visit,
and <i>I</i> came.”</p>

<p>“Not very willingly, it would seem,”
with a short laugh.</p>

<p>“No; I held out as long as I could.
I am—or rather was—the useful one at
home.”</p>

<p>“And did your aunt and uncle stipulate
for the most useful niece?”</p>

<p>“By no means—they—they, to tell you
the truth, they asked for the <i>pretty</i> one,
and I am not the beauty of the family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“No? Am I to take your word for that,
or are you merely fishing?”</p>

<p>“I assure you that I am not. I am
afraid my aunt will be disappointed; but
it was unavoidable. My eldest sister writes,
and could not well give up what she calls
her literary customers. My next sister is—is—not
strong, and so they sent me—a
<i>dernier ressort</i>.”</p>

<p>She was speaking quite frankly to this
stranger, and felt rather ashamed of her
garrulity; but he had a pleasant voice, he
was the first friendly soul she had come
across since she had left home, and she was
desperately home-sick. A long solitary railway
journey had only increased her complaint,
and she was ready to talk of home
to <i>any one</i>—would probably have talked
of it to the chuprassi,—if he could have
understood her!</p>

<p>Her escort had been an unscrupulous,
selfish little woman, whose nurse, having
proved a bad sailor, literally saddled her
good-natured, inexperienced charge with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the care of two unruly children, and this
in a manner that excited considerable
indignation among her fellow passengers.</p>

<p>“Why should you call yourself a <i>dernier
ressort</i>?” inquired her companion, after
a pause, during which they continued to
stumble along, she holding timidly by the
young man’s arm.</p>

<p>“Because I am; and I told them at home
with my very last breath that I was not
a bit suited for coming out here, and mixing
with strangers—nothing but strangers—and
going perpetually into what is called
‘smart’ society, and beginning a perfectly
novel kind of life. I shall get into no end
of scrapes.”</p>

<p>“May I ask your reason for this dismal
prophecy?”</p>

<p>“Surely you can guess! Because I
cannot hold my tongue. I blurt out the
first thing that comes into my head. If I
think a thing wrong, or odd, I must say so;
I cannot help it, I am incurable. People
at home are used to me, and don’t mind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
Also, I have a frightful and wholly
unconscious habit of selecting the most
uncomfortable topics, and an extremely
bad memory for the names and faces of
people with whom I have but a slight
acquaintance; so you see that I am not
likely to be a social success!”</p>

<p>“Let us hope that you take a gloomy
view of yourself. For instance, what is
your idea of an uncomfortable topic?”</p>

<p>“If I am talking to a person with a cast
in the eye, I am positively certain ere long
to find myself conversing volubly about
squints; or, if my partner wears a wig, I
am bound to bring wigs on the tapis. I
believe I am possessed by some mischievous
imp, who enjoys my subsequent torture.”</p>

<p>“Pray how do you know that <i>I</i> have not
a squint, or a wig, or both? A wig would
not be half a bad thing in this hot climate;
to take off your hair as you do your hat
would often be a great relief! Ah, here
we are coming to the scene of the collision
at last,” and presently they passed by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
long row of waggons, and then two huge
engines, one across the line, the other
reared up against it; an immense bonfire
burnt on the bank, and threw the great
black monsters into strong outline. Further
on they came to a gate and level crossing.
The gate of the keeper’s hut stood wide
open, and on the threshold a grey-haired
old woman sat with her head between her
knees, sobbing; within were moans, as if
wrung from a sufferer in acute anguish.
Honor’s unknown companion suddenly
halted, and exclaimed impulsively—</p>

<p>“I’m afraid some one has been badly
hurt; if you don’t mind, I’ll just go and
see.”</p>

<p>Almost ere she had nodded a quick
affirmative, he had vaulted over the gate,
and left her.</p>

</div>


<p>In all her life, the youngest Miss Gordon
had never felt so utterly solitary or forsaken
as now, when she stood alone on the line
of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.
Before her the party of natives, with their
twinkling lanterns, were gradually reaching
vanishing point; behind her was a long,
still procession of trucks and waggons, that
looked like some dreadful black monster
waiting for its prey; on either hand
stretched the greyish unknown mysterious
landscape, from which strange unfamiliar
sounds, in the shape of croakings and cries,
were audible. Oh! when would her nameless
companion return? She glanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
anxiously towards the hut, it was beyond
the gate, and down a steep bank, away
from the road; animated figures seemed
to pass to and fro against the lighted open
door. Ah! here came one of them, her
escort, who had in point of fact been only
absent five minutes, and not, as she imagined,
half an hour.</p>

<p>“It is a stoker who has been cut about
the head and badly scalded,” he explained
breathlessly. “They are waiting for an
apothecary from Okara, and meanwhile
they are trying a native herb and a charm.
They don’t seem to do the poor chap much
good. I think I might be able to do something
better for him, though I have no
experience, beyond seeing accidents at
football and out hunting; but I cannot
leave you here like this, and yet I cannot
well ask you inside the hut, the heat is
like a furnace—and—altogether—it—it
would be too much for you, but if you would
not mind waiting outside just for a few
minutes, I’d get you something to sit on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you, but I would rather go in—I
have attended an ambulance class—‘first
aid,’ you know, and perhaps I may be of some
little use; there is sticking-plaster, eau-de-Cologne,
and a pair of scissors in my bag.”</p>

<p>“Well, mind; you must brace up your
nerves,” he answered, as he pushed open
the gate, and led her down the crumbling
sandy incline.</p>

<p>The heat within the hut was almost
suffocating; as the girl, following her guide,
entered, every eye was instantly fixed upon
her in wide surprise.</p>

<p>By the light of a small earthen lamp,
which smoked horribly, she distinguished
the figure of a man crouching on the edge
of a charpoy; he was breathing in hard
hoarse gasps, and bleeding from a great
gash above his eye.</p>

<p>A Eurasian, in a checked cotton suit,
stood by, talking incessantly—but doing
nothing else. There were also present,
besides the old woman—a veritable
shrivelled-up hag—two native men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
possibly the “bhai-bands,” or chums of
the sufferer; in a corner, a large black
pariah sat watching everything, with a pair
of unwinking yellow eyes; and on another
charpoy lay a still figure, covered with a
sheet. A few earthen chatties, a mat, a
huka, and some gaudy English prints—for
the most part nailed upside down—completed
the picture. Hitherto the travelling
companions had been to each other merely
the embodiment of an undefined figure and
a voice; the light of the little mud lamp,
whose curling smoke threw outlines of
dancing black devils on the walls, now
introduced them for the first time face to
face. To Honor Gordon stood revealed an
unexpectedly good-looking young man,
slight and well built, with severely cut
features, and a pair of handsome hazel eyes,
which were surveying her gravely. A
gentleman, not merely in his speech and
actions, but in his bearing.</p>

<p>He, on his part, was not in the least
surprised to behold a pale but decidedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
pretty girl; by means of some mysterious
instinct he had long made up his mind that
the owner of such a delicate hand and
sweet clear voice could not be otherwise
than fair to see.</p>

<p>“The apothecary cannot be here for one
hour!” exclaimed the Eurasian, glibly.
“He,” pointing to the patient, “is very
bad. We have put some herbs to his arm,
and the back of his head; but I, myself,
think that he will <i>die</i>!” he concluded with
an air of melancholy importance.</p>

<p>Some kind of a bandage was the first
thing Honor asked for, and asked for in
vain; she then quickly unwound the
puggaree from her topee, and tore it into
three parts.</p>

<p>Then she bathed and bandaged the man’s
head, with quick and sympathetic fingers,
whilst Jervis held the lamp, offered suggestions,
and looked on, no less impressed
than amazed; he had hitherto had an idea
that girls always screamed and shrank
away from the sight of blood and horrors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>This girl, though undeniably white, was
as cool and self-possessed, as firm, yet
gentle, as any capable professional nurse.</p>

<p>The scalded arm and hand—a shocking
spectacle—were attended to by both. The
great thing was to exclude the air, and give
the sufferer at least temporary relief. With
some native flour, a bandage was deftly
applied, the arm placed in a sling, and the
patient’s head was bathed with water and
eau-de-Cologne. Fanned assiduously by the
girl’s fan, he began to feel restored, he had
been given heart, he had been assured that
his hurts were not mortal, and presently he
languidly declared himself better.</p>

<p>The natives who stood round, whilst the
sahib and Miss Sahib ministered so quickly
and effectually to their friend, now changed
their lamentations to loud ejaculations of
wonder and praise. Miss Gordon was
amazed to hear her companion giving
directions to these spectators in fluent and
sonorous Hindustani, and still more
astounded when, as she took up her topee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
preparatory to departure, the Eurasian
turned to him, and said in an impressive
squeak—</p>

<p>“Sir, your wife is a saint—an angel of
goodness”—and then, as an hasty afterthought,
he added, “and beauty!”</p>

<p>Before Jervis could collect his wits and
speak, she had replied—</p>

<p>“I am not this gentleman’s wife; we are
only fellow-passengers. Why should you
think so?” she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“Because—oh, <i>please</i> do not be angry—you
looked so suitable,” he answered with
disarming candour. “Truly, I hope you
may be married <i>yet</i>, and I wish you both
riches, long life, and great happiness,” he
added, bowing very low, lamp in hand.</p>

<p>Honor passed out of the hut, with her
head held extraordinarily high, scrambled
up the bank, and proceeded along the line
at a headlong pace in indignant silence.</p>

<p>She now maintained a considerable
distance between herself and her escort; no
doubt her eyes were becoming accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
to the dim light, and at any rate there was
that in her air which prevented him
offering either arm or hand. In spite of
the recent scene in which they had both
been actors, where he had clipped hair and
cut plaster, and she had applied bandages
and scanty remedies to the same “case,”
they were not drawn closer together; on the
contrary, they were much further apart
than during the first portion of their walk,
and the young lady’s confidences had now
entirely ceased. She confined herself
exclusively to a few bald remarks about the
patient, and the climate, remarks issued at
intervals of ten minutes, and her answers
to his observations were confined to “Yes”
and “No.” At last Okara station was
reached; and, to tell the truth, neither of
them were sorry to bring their <i>tête-à-tête</i>
to a conclusion. The dazzling lights on
the platform made their eyes blink, as they
threaded their way to the general refreshment
room, discovering it readily enough
by sounds of many and merry voices, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
were evidently availing themselves of its
somewhat limited resources.</p>

<p>It was not a very large apartment, but it
was full. The table was covered with a
thin native tablecloth, two large lamps with
punkah tops, and two cruet-stands and an
American ice-pitcher were placed at formal
intervals down the middle. It was surrounded
with people, who were eating,
drinking, and talking. At the further end
sat Captain Waring, supported on either
hand by his two fair companions, three
men—young and noisy, whom they evidently
knew—and a prim, elderly woman, who
looked inexpressibly shocked at the company,
and had pointedly fenced herself off
from Mrs. Bellett with a teapot and a wine-card.
Captain Waring’s friends had not
partaken of tea (as the champagne-bottle
testified). The tongue, cake, and fruit had
also evidently received distinguished marks
of their esteem. Mrs. Bellett put up her
long eyeglass, and surveyed exhaustively
the pair who now entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“Hullo, Mark! What ages you have
been!” exclaimed his cousin. “We can
make room at this corner—come along,
old man.”</p>

<p>Mark and his companion found themselves
posted at the two corners at the end
of the table, and were for the moment the
cynosure of all eyes.</p>

<p>In a few seconds, as soon as the newcomers
had been looked after and given the
scraps, the party continued their interrupted
conversation with redoubled animation.
They all appeared to know one
another intimately. Captain Waring had
evidently fallen among old friends. They
discussed people and places—to which the
others were strangers—and Mrs. Bellett
was particularly animated, and laughed incessantly—chiefly
at her own remarks.</p>

<p>“And so Lalla Paske is going to her
Aunt Ida? I thought Ida Langrishe <i>hated</i>
girls. I wonder if she will be able to
manage her niece, and what sort of a
chaperon she will make?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“A splendid one, I should say,” responded
a man in a suit like a five-barred
gate—“on the principle of set a thief to
catch a thief.”</p>

<p>“And old Mother Brande, up at Shirani,
is expecting a niece too. What fun it will
be! What rivalry between her and Ida!
What husband-hunting, and scheming, and
match-making! It will be as good as one
of Oscar Wilde’s plays. I am rather sorry
that I shall not be there to see. I shall
get people to write to me—you for one,
Captain Waring,” and she nodded at him
graciously.</p>

<p>Mark noticed his companion, who had
been drinking water (deluded girl—railway
station water), put down her glass hastily,
and fix her eyes on Mrs. Bellett. No one
could call her pale <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>“I wonder what Mrs. Brande’s niece
will be like?” drawled her sister. “I
wonder if she, like her aunt, has been in
domestic service. He, he, he!” she
giggled affectedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>There was a general laugh, in the midst
of which a clear treble voice was heard—</p>

<p>“If you particularly wish to know, I can
answer <i>that</i> question.” It was the pale
girl who was speaking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Coote simply glared, too astounded
to utter a syllable.</p>

<p>“I was not aware that my aunt had ever
been in domestic service; but I can relieve
you at once of all anxiety about myself.
I have never been in any situation, and <i>this</i>
is the nearest approach I have ever made
to the servants’ hall!”</p>

<p>If the lamp in front of them had suddenly
exploded, there could scarcely have
been more general consternation. Mrs.
Bellett gasped like a newly-landed fish;
Captain Waring, purple with suppressed
laughter, was vainly cudgelling his brain
for some suitable and soothing remark,
when the door was flung back by the guard,
bawling—</p>

<p>“Take your seats—take your seats,
please, passengers by the Cawnpore mail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly the train had never arrived
at a more propitious moment. The company
rose with one consent, thrust back
their chairs, snatched up their parcels, and
hurried precipitately out of the room,
leaving Honor and her escort <i>vis-à-vis</i> and
all alone.</p>

<p>“If those are specimens of Englishwomen
in India,” she exclaimed, “give <i>me</i>
the society of the natives; that dear old
creature in the hut was far more of a lady.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must not judge by Mrs.
Bellett! I am sure she must be unique.
I have never seen any one like her, so far,”
he remarked consolingly.</p>

<p>“I told you,” becoming calmer, and
rising as she spoke, “that I could not
hold my tongue. I can <i>not</i> keep quiet.
You see I have lost no time—I have begun
already. Of course, the proper thing for
me to have done would have been to sit
still and make no remark, instead of
hurling a bombshell into the enemy’s camp.
I have disgraced myself and you; they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
say, ‘Evil communications corrupt good
manners.’ I can easily find a carriage.
Ah, here is my treasure of a chuprassi.
You have been extremely kind; but your
friends are waiting for you, and really you
had better not be seen with me any
longer.”</p>

<p>She was very tall; and when she drew
herself up their eyes were nearly on a level.
She looked straight at him, and held out
her hand with a somewhat forced smile.</p>

<p>He smiled also as he replied, “I consider
it an honour to be seen with you, under any
circumstances, and I shall certainly see
you off. Our train is not leaving for five
minutes. A ladies’ compartment, I presume,
and <i>not</i> with Mrs. Bellett?”</p>

<p>They walked slowly along the platform,
past the carriage in which Mrs. Bellett and
her sister were arranging their animals and
parcels with much shrill hilarity.</p>

<p>Miss Gordon was so fortunate as to
secure a compartment to herself—the imbecile
chuprassi gibbering and gesticulating,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
whilst the sahib handed in her slender
stock of belongings. As the train moved
away, she leant out of the window and
nodded a smiling farewell.</p>

<p>How good-looking he was as he stood
under the lamp with his hat off! How
nice he had been to her—exactly like a
brother! She drew back with a long
breath, that was almost a sigh, as she said
to herself, “Of course I shall never see
him again.”</p>

<p>Letter from Mrs. Brande, Allahabad,to
Pelham Brande, Esq., Shirani:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear P.</span></p>

<p>“She arrived yesterday, so you
may expect us on Saturday. Send Nubboo
down to Nath Tal Dâk Bungalow on
Thursday, to cook our dinner, and don’t
allow him <i>more</i> than <i>six</i> coolies and <i>one</i>
pony. Honor seems to feel the heat a
great deal, though she is thin, and not fat
like me. At first sight, I must tell you, I
was <i>terribly</i> disappointed. When I saw her
step out of the railway carriage, a tall girl
in a crumpled white dress, with a hideous
bazar topee, and no puggaree—her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
very pale and covered with smuts, I felt
ready to burst into tears. She looked very
nervous and surprised too. However, of
course I said nothing, she wasn’t to know
that I had asked for the <i>pretty one</i>, and we
drove back to the Hodsons’ both in the
very lowest spirits. She was tired, the
train had broken down, and they had all to
get out and walk miles in the middle of
the night. After a while, when she had
had her tea, and a bath, and a real good
rest, and changed her dress, I declare I
thought it was another person, when she
walked into the room. I found her uncommonly
good-looking, and in five minutes’
time she seemed really pretty. She has a
lovely smile and teeth to match, and fine
eyes, and when she speaks her face lights
up wonderfully. Her hair is brown, just
plain brown, no colour in it, but very thick
and fine. I know you will be awfully disappointed
in her complexion, as you were
such a one for admiring a beautiful skin.
She has not <i>got any at all</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“Just a pale clear colour and no more, but
her figure is most beautiful. Indeed, every
time I look at her I notice something new;
now the nape of her neck, now her ears—all
just so many models. She is, of course,
a little shy and strange, but is simple and
easily pleased; and, thank goodness, has no
<i>grand airs</i>. I took her to Madame Peter
(such stuff her calling herself Pierre) to
order some gowns for dinner parties. I
thought of a figured yellow satin and a ruby
plush, she being dark; but she would not
<i>hear</i> of them, and all she would take was a
couple of cottons. I can see she wants to
choose her own clothes, and that she would
like to have a say in <i>mine</i> too; and knows
a good deal about dress, and fashions, and
is clever at milinery (I always forget if there
are two ‘L’s,’ but you won’t mind). She
says she is fond of dancing and tennis, but
cannot ride or sing, which is a pity.</p>

<p>“She has brought a fiddle with her, and
she <i>plays</i> on it, she tells me. It reminds
<i>me</i> of a blind beggar with a dog for coppers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
but the Hodsons say it is all the go at
home; they admire Honor immensely.</p>

<p>“I suppose Mrs. Langrishe’s girl has
arrived. I hear she is no taller than sixpence
worth of half-pence, but the <i>biggest
flirt</i> in India.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">“Yours affectionately,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Sarabella Brande</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>“P.S.—I hope Ben is well, and that he
will take to her.”</p>
</div>

<p>Honor had also written home announcing
her arrival, dwelling on her aunt’s kindness,
and making the best of everything, knowing
that long extracts from her letter would be
read aloud to inquiring friends. She felt
dreadfully home-sick, as she penned her
cheerful epistle. How she wished that she
could put herself into the envelope, and
find herself once more in that bright but
faded drawing-room, with its deep window-seats,
cosy chairs, and tinkling cottage piano.
Every vase and bowl would be crammed
with spring flowers. Jessie would be pouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
out tea, whilst her mother was telling
her visitors that she had had a nice long
letter from Honor, who was in raptures with
India, and as happy as the day was long!</p>

<p>She took particular care that her tears
did not fall upon the paper, as she penned
this deceitful effusion. It was dreadful not
to see one familiar face or object. This
new world looked so wide, and so strange.
She felt lost in the immense bedroom in
which she was writing—with its bare lofty
walls, matted floor, and creaking punkah.
A nondescript dog from the stables had
stolen in behind one of the door chicks.
She called to it, eager to make friends.
Surely dogs were dogs the whole world
over!—but the creature did not understand
what she said, simply stared interrogatively
and slunk away. She saw many
novel sights, as she drove in the cool of the
evening in Mrs. Hodson’s roomy landau,
along the broad planted roads of Allahabad,
and watched the bheesties watering
the scorching white dust, which actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
appeared to steam and bubble; she beheld
rattling ekkas, crammed with passengers,
and drawn by one wicked-looking, ill-used
pony; orderlies on trotting camels; fat
native gentlemen in broughams, lean and
pallid English sahibs in dog-carts. It was
extremely warm; the so-called “evening
breeze” consisted of puffs of hot wind, with
a dash of sand. Most of the Allahabad
ladies were already on the hills.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande was far too well-seasoned an
Anglo-Indian not to appreciate the wisdom
of travelling in comfort. She had her own
servants in attendance, and plenty of
pillows, fans, ice, fruit, and eau-de-Cologne;
far be it from <i>her</i> to journey with merely a
hand-bag and parasol!</p>

<p>Honor in a comfortable corner, with
several down cushions at her back, and a
book on her knee, sat staring out on the
unaccustomed prospect that seemed to
glide slowly past the carriage windows.
Here was a different country to that which
she had already traversed: great tracts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
grain, poppies, and sugar cane, pointed to
the principal products of the North West.
She was resolved to see and note everything—even
to the white waterfowl, and
the long-legged cranes which lounged
among the marshes—so as to be able to
write full details in the next home letter.</p>

<p>As they passed through the Terai—that
breathless belt of jungle—the blue hills
began to loom largely into the view.
Finally, the train drew up at a platform
almost at the foot of them, and one phase
of the journey was over.</p>

<p>Honor could not help admiring her aunt,
as she stepped out with an air that
betokened that she was now monarch of all
she surveyed (she was encased in a cream-coloured
dust-cloak and topee to match, and
looked like an immense button mushroom).
She briefly disposed of clamouring coolies,
gave orders to her attendants in vigorous
Hindustani, and led the way to the back
of the station, where were a collection of
long open boxes—each box had a seat, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
was tied to two poles—and all were
assembled in the midst of a maddening din
and accents of an unknown tongue.</p>

<p>“We go in these jampans,” explained
Mrs. Brande, briskly. “Get in, Honor,
and I’ll pack you up; tie on your veil,
put your rug over your knees, and you will
be very comfortable.”</p>

<p>But Honor felt quite the reverse, when
she found herself suddenly hoisted up on
men’s shoulders, and borne rapidly away
in the wake of her aunt, who seemed perfectly
at home under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>For some time they kept to a broad
metalled road lined with great forest trees,
then they went across a swing-bridge, up a
narrow steep path, that twisted among the
woods, overhanging the rocky bed of an
almost dry river. This so-called bridle-path
wound round the hills for miles, every
sharp curve seemed to bring them higher;
once they encountered a drove of pack
ponies thundering down on their return
journey to the plains, miserable thin little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
beasts, who never seem to have time to eat—or,
indeed, anything to eat, if they <i>had</i>
leisure. Mrs. Brande and her party met
but few people, save occasionally some
broad-shouldered coolie struggling upward
with a huge load bound on his back, and
looking like a modern Atlas. Once they
passed a jaunty native girl, riding a pony,
man fashion, and exchanging gibes and
repartees with her companions, and once
they met a European—a young man
dressed in flannels and a blazer, clattering
down at break-neck speed, singing at the
top of his voice, “Slattery’s Mounted
Foot”—a curly-headed, sunburnt, merry
youth, who stopped his song and his steed
the moment he caught sight of Mrs.
Brande.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” he shouted. “Welcome back!
Welcome the coming. Speed,” laying his
hand on his heart, “the parting guest.”</p>

<p>“Where are you off to?” inquired the
lady imperiously.</p>

<p>“Only to the station. We are getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
up grand theatricals; and in spite of coolies,
and messages, and furious letters, none of
our properties have been forwarded, and I
began to suspect that the Baboo might be
having a play of his own, and I am going
down to look him up. Am I not energetic?
Don’t I deserve a vote of public thanks?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Your journey is nothing,” cried
Mrs. Brande, with great scorn. “Why,
I’ve been to Allahabad, where the thermometer
is 95° in the shade.”</p>

<p>“Yes, down in all the heat, and for a far
more worthy object,” glancing at Honor.
“You may rely on me, I shall see that you
are recommended for a D.S.O.”</p>

<p>“What an impudent boy you are!” retorted
the matron; and half turning her
head, she said to her companion, “Honor,
this is Mr. Joy—he is <i>quite</i> mad. Mr. Joy,
this is my niece, Miss Gordon, just out from
England” (her invariable formula).</p>

<p>Mr. Joy swept off his topee to his saddle-bow.</p>

<p>“And what’s the news?” continued Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Brande. “Has Mrs. Langrishe’s niece come
up?” she asked peremptorily.</p>

<p>“Yes, arrived two days ago—the early
bird, you see,” he added, with a malicious
twinkle of his little eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t see; and every one knows that
the worm was a <i>fool</i>. What is she
like?”</p>

<p>“Like a fairy, and dances to match,”
replied Mr. Joy, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Come, come; what do you know about
fairies? Is she pretty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and full of life, and go, and chic.”</p>

<p>“Cheek! I’m not surprised at <i>that</i>,
seeing she is Mrs. Langrishe’s own niece.”</p>

<p>“Chic is a French word, don’t you know?
and means—well, I can’t exactly explain.
Anyway, Miss Paske will be a great acquisition.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will soon be able to judge for
yourself. She acts first class, and plays the
banjo like an angel.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense you talk, Toby Joy!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
Whoever heard of an angel playing anything
but a ’arp.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Miss Gordon,” said Toby,
turning suddenly to her, “I hope you act.”</p>

<p>“No; I have never acted in my life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is nothing! All women are
born actresses. Surely, then, you sing—you
have a singing face?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say that, in that case, my
face belies me.”</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate,” with an air of desperation,
“you could dance in a burlesque?”</p>

<p>“Get away!” screamed Mrs. Brande.
“Dance in a burlesque! I am glad her
mother does not hear you. Never mind
him, Honor; he is crazy about acting and
dancing, and thinks of nothing else.”</p>

<p>“All work and no <i>plays</i>, make Jack a
dull boy,” he retorted.</p>

<p>“Who else is up?” demanded Mrs.
Brande, severely.</p>

<p>“Oh, the usual set, I believe. Lloyds,
Clovers, Valpys, Dashwoods, a signalling
class, a standing camp, a baronet; there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
also a millionaire just about half way.
You’ll find a fellow called Waring at Nath
Tal Dâk Bungalow—he was in the service
once, and has now come in for tons of
money, and is a gentleman at large—very
keen about racing and sport. I expect he
will live at our mess.”</p>

<p>“Then he is not married?” said Mrs.
Brande, in a tone of unaffected satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Not he! Perish the thought! He has
a companion, a young chap he takes about
with him, a sort of hanger-on and poor
relation.”</p>

<p>“What is he like? Of course I mean the
millionaire?”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>of course</i>,” with an affable nod;
“cheery, good-looking sort of chap, that
would be an A1 hero of a novel.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande glanced swiftly at Honor,
and heaved a gentle sigh of contentment as
she exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we ought to be moving
on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for you will find the bungalow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
crammed with Tommies and their wives.
Give the millionaire my love. Au revoir,
Mrs. Brande. <i>Au revoir</i>, Miss Gordon.
You’ll think over the burlesque, and help
us in some way, won’t you?” and with a
valedictory wave of his hand he dashed off.</p>

<p>“He is a harmless lunatic, my dear,”
explained the aunt to her niece, as they
were carried forward side by side. “Thinks
of nothing but play-acting, and always in
hot water with his colonel; but no one
is ever really angry with Toby, he is such
a mere boy.”</p>

<p>“He must be three and twenty, and——”</p>

<p>“Look at the baggage just in front,”
interrupted Mrs. Brande, excitedly. “These
must be Captain Waring’s coolies,” and to
Honor’s amazement she imperiously called
a halt, and interrogated them sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, for a sahib—two sahibs at Nath
Tal,” grunted the hill men.</p>

<p>“What a quantity,” she cried, shamelessly
passing each load in solemn review. “See
what a lovely dressing-bag and a tiffin-basket.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
I believe”—reckoning—“no less
than five portmanteaus, all solid leather,
Captain C. Waring; and look at the gun-cases,
and that big box between two men
is saddlery—I know the shape.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Sara, do you not think we
ought to get on?” urged her companion.
“We are delaying his men.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, learn to know that there
is <i>nothing</i> a coolie likes better than being
delayed. There is no hurry, and I am
really interested in this young man. I
want to see where he has been, where he
has come from.” In answer to an imperative
sentence in a tongue unknown
to Honor, a grinning coolie turned his
back, on which was strapped a portmanteau,
for Mrs. Brande’s deliberate inspection.</p>

<p>It proved to be covered with labels, and
she read aloud with much unction and for
Honor’s benefit—</p>

<p>“Victoria—that’s New South Wales—Paris,
Brindisi, Bombay, Poonah, Arkomon,
Calcutta, Galle, Lucknow. Bless us and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
save us, he has been staying at Government
House, Calcutta, and been half over the
world! See what it is to have money!” and
she made a sign to her jampannis to continue
her journey. Presently they passed
two more coolies, lightly loaded with a
rather meagre kit; these she did not think
it necessary to question.</p>

<p>“Those are the cousin’s things,” she
explained contemptuously, “M. J., the
hanger-on. Awful shabby, only a bag, and
a couple of boxes. You could tell the owner
was a poor man.”</p>

<p>Honor made no reply. She began to have
an idea that she had seen this poor young
man before, or were two cousins travelling
together for travelling’s sake, a common
feature in India. It would not surprise her
much were she to find her companion of
that three-mile walk awaiting his slender
baggage at Nath Tal Bungalow.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Brande was borne upwards, her
spirits seemed to rise simultaneously with
her body. She was about to make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
acquaintance of a millionaire, and could
cultivate his friendship comfortably, undisturbed
by the machinations of her crafty
rival. She would invite him to be her
guest for the two days they would be
journeying together, and by this means
steal a nice long march (in every sense of
the word) on Mrs. Langrishe!</p>

</div>


<p>As the sun died down, the moon arose
above the hills and lighted the travellers
along a path winding by the shores of an
irregular mountain lake, and overhung by
a multitude of cherry trees in full blossom.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Mrs. Brande, joyfully,
“there in front you see the lights of the
Dâk Bungalow at last. You will be glad of
your dinner, and I’m sure <i>I</i> shall.”</p>

<p>Two men, who sat in the verandah of the
same rest-house, would also have been most
thankful for theirs. The straggling building
appeared full of soldiers and their wives,
and there seemed no immediate prospect of
a meal. The kitchen had been taken possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
of by the majestic cook of a burra
mem sahib, who was shortly expected, and
the appetites of a couple of insignificant
strangers must therefore be restrained.</p>

<p>These travellers were, of course, Captain
Waring and Mark Jervis, whom the former
invariably alluded to as “his cousin.” It
was a convenient title, and accounted for
their close companionship. At first Mark
had been disposed to correct this statement,
and murmur, “Not cousins, but connections,”
but had been silenced by Clarence
petulantly exclaiming—</p>

<p>“Cousins and connections are the same
thing. Who cares a straw what we are?
And what’s the good of bothering?”</p>

<p>“I’m nearly mad with hunger,” groaned
Captain Waring. “I’ve eaten nothing for
ten hours but one hard-boiled egg.”</p>

<p>“Smoke, as the Indians do,” suggested
his comrade unfeelingly, “or draw in your
belt a couple of holes. Anyway, a little
starvation will do you no harm—you are
getting fat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder, if I went and sat upon the
steps with a placard round my neck, on
which was written, ‘I am starving,’ if this
good lady would give us a dinner? Hunger
is bad enough, but the exquisite smell of
her roast mutton aggravates my pangs.”</p>

<p>“You have only to show yourself, and
she will invite you.”</p>

<p>“How do you know, and why do you
cruelly raise my hopes?”</p>

<p>“Because I hear that she is the soul of
hospitality, and that she has the best cook
on the hills.”</p>

<p>“May I ask how you discovered this
really valuable piece of information?”</p>

<p>“From the harum-scarum youth who
passed this afternoon. He forgot to mention
her name.”</p>

<p>“Here she comes along by the weir,”
interrupted Waring. “Mark the excitement
among the servants—<i>her</i> meal will be
ready to the minute. She must be truly
a great woman, and has already earned
my respect. If she asks me to dinner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
I shall love her. What do you say,
Mark?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think, since you put it in that
way, that I should find it easier to love the
young lady!”</p>

<p>“I thought you fought shy of young
ladies; and you must have cat’s eyes if you
can see one at this distance.”</p>

<p>“I have the use of my ears, and I have
had nothing to do, but concentrate my
attention on what is evidently to be the
<i>only</i> meal of the evening. I heard the cook
telling the khitmatghar to lay a place for
the ‘Miss Sahib.’”</p>

<p>“What a thing it is to be observant!”
cried Captain Waring. “And here they
are. By George! she <i>is</i> a heavy weight!”
alluding to Mrs. Brande, who was now let
down with a dump, that spoke a whole
volume of relief.</p>

<p>The lady ascended the verandah with
slow and solid steps, cast a swift glance at
the famishing pair, and went into her own
well-warmed room, where a table neatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
laid, and adorned with cherry-blossoms,
awaited her.</p>

<p>“Lay two more places,” were her first
commands to the salaaming Khitmatghar;
then to her niece, “I am going to ask those
two men to dinner.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know them, Aunt Sara!”
she expostulated rather timidly.</p>

<p>“I know of them, and that is quite
enough at a dâk bungalow. We are not so
stiff as you are in England; we are all, as
it were, in the same set out here; and I am
sure Captain Waring will be thankful to
join us, unless he happens to be a born
idiot. In this bungalow there is nothing
to be had but candles and jam. I know
it of old. People who pass up, are like a
swarm of locusts, and leave nothing behind
them, but empty tins and bottles. Now <i>I</i>
can give him club mutton and champagne.”</p>

<p>Having carefully arranged her dress, put
on her two best diamond rings, and a
blue cap (N.B.—Blue had always been
her colour), Mrs. Brande sailed out into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the verandah, and thus accosted the
strangers—</p>

<p>“I shall be very happy if you two gentlemen
will dine with me in my rooms.”</p>

<p>“You are really too good,” returned
Captain Waring, springing to his feet and
making a somewhat exaggerated bow. “We
shall be delighted, for there seems no prospect
of our getting anything to eat before
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You shall have something to eat in less
than five minutes,” was Mrs. Brande’s reassuring
answer, as she led the way to her
own apartment.</p>

<p>“This,” waving her hand towards Honor,
“is my niece, Miss Gordon, just out from
England. I am Mrs. Brande—my husband
is in the Council.”</p>

<p>“We have had the pleasure of meeting
Miss Gordon before,” said Captain Waring;
“this will not be the first time we have
sat at the same table,” and he glanced at
her, with sly significance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” faltered Honor, with a heightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
colour, as she bowed and shook hands with
Mark. “This is the gentleman of whom
I told you, Aunt Sara, who rescued me
when I was left alone in the train.”</p>

<p>“Ah! indeed,” said Mrs. Brande, sitting
down as she spoke, and deliberately unfolding
her serviette, “I’m sure I’m greatly
obliged to him,” but she secretly wished
that on that occasion Honor had been befriended
by his rich associate.</p>

<p>“Let me introduce him to you, Mrs.
Brande—his name is Jervis,” said Captain
Waring, with his most jovial air. “He is
young, idle, and unmarried. My name is
Waring. I was in the Rutlands, but I
chucked the service some time ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, now we know all about each
other” (oh, deluded lady!) “let us begin
our dinner,” said Mrs. Brande. “I am sure
we are all starving.”</p>

<p>Dinner proved to be excellent, and included
mahseer from the lake, wild duck
from the marshes, and club mutton. No!
Mrs. Brande’s “chef” had not been over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
praised. At first every one (especially the
hostess and Clarence Waring) was too
frankly hungry to talk, but after a time
they began to discuss the weather, the
local insects, and their journey—not in the
formal manner common to Britons on their
mournful travels—but in a friendly, homely
fashion, suitable to a whitewashed apartment,
with the hostess’s bed in one corner.</p>

<p>Whilst the two men conversed with her
niece, Mrs. Brande critically surveyed them,
“took stock” as she said to herself.
Captain Waring was a man of five or six
and thirty, well set up, and soldierly looking;
he had dark cropped hair, bold merry
eyes, and was handsome, though sunburnt
to a deep tan, and his face was deeply
lined—those in his forehead looking as if
they had been ruled and cut into the very
bone—nevertheless, his habitual expression
was as gay and animated as that of Toby
Joy himself. He had an extremely well-to-do
air (undoubtedly had never known a
money care in his life), he wore his clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
with ease, they fitted him admirably, his
watch, studs, and linen were of the finest
quality; moreover, he appreciated a good
dinner, seemed to accept the best of everything
as a matter of course, and looked
about intelligently for peppers and sauces,
which were fortunately forthcoming.</p>

<p>“The companion,” as Mrs. Brande mentally
called him, was a younger man, in fact
a mere youth of about two and twenty, well
set up, squarely built, with good shoulders
and a determined mouth and chin. He
wore a suit of flannels, a silver watch, with
a leather chain, and looked exactly what
he was—an idle, poor hanger-on!</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande left him to talk to Honor,
and indeed entirely neglected him for his
more important kinsman. Her niece was
secretly aware of (and resented) her aunt’s
preference, and redoubled her efforts to
entertain her slighted fellow-traveller. She
had a fellow-feeling for him also. Were they
not both dependents—both poor relations?</p>

<p>“Well, Captain Waring, so you are coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
up to see Shirani?” said Mrs. Brande, with
her most gracious air.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I rather want to recall old
times out here, and have a nice lazy summer
in the hills.”</p>

<p>“Then you have been in India all the
winter?” (The inspection of his kit the
crafty lady kept to herself.)</p>

<p>“Yes. We came out in October. Had
a bit of a shoot in Travancore, and had
a couple of months in Calcutta.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you came across a Miss
Paske, there? Though I don’t suppose she
was in the Government House set. Her
uncle is a nobody.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. We know Miss Paske, don’t
we, Mark? She was very much in the
Government House set. All the A.D.C’s
adored her. A little bit of a thing, with
tow-coloured, fluffy hair, and a <i>nez retroussé</i>.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about her nose or hair,
but she is at Shirani now.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! I am delighted
to hear it. She is capital fun!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Brande’s face fell. She sat crumbling
her bread for some seconds, and then
said absently, “Did you notice those
monkeys on the way up?”</p>

<p>She had a peculiar habit of suddenly
jumping from one topic to another,
figuratively, at the opposite pole. She
declared that her ideas travelled at times
faster than her speech. Possibly she had her
own consecutive, if rapid, train of thought,
and may thus have connected Miss Paske
with apes.</p>

<p>“Yes, swarms of those old grey fellows
with black faces. I suppose they have a
fair club at Shirani, and keep up the whist-room?
Are there many men who play?”</p>

<p>“Only too many. I don’t approve of
cards—at least gambling. I do love a game
of whist—I play a half-anna stamp on the
rubber, just to give it a little interest.”</p>

<p>“Do they play high at Shirani?” he
asked with a touch of impatience.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe they do; and that horrid
old Colonel Sladen is the worst of all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“What! is he still up here? he used to
play a first-class rubber.”</p>

<p>“He will play anything—high or low
stakes—at either night or day—he pays—his
wife pays,” concluded Mrs. Brande,
looking quite ferocious.</p>

<p>“Oh, is she out again? Nice little
woman.”</p>

<p>“Out <i>again</i>! She has never been home
yet,” and she proceeded to detail that
lady’s grievances, whilst her companion’s
roving eyes settled on his cousin and Miss
Gordon.</p>

<p>She was a remarkable-looking, even
fascinating girl, quite different to his
impression of her at first sight. She had a
radiant smile, wonderfully expressive eyes
(those eyes alone made her beautiful, and
lifted her completely out of the commonplace),
and a high-bred air. Strange that
she should be related to this vulgar old
woman, and little did the vulgar old woman
guess how she had been championed by her
English niece. The moon shining full on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
the lake tempted the whole party out of
doors. Captain Waring made a basely
ungrateful (but wholly vain) attempt to
exchange ladies with his friend. Mrs.
Brande, however, loudly called upon him to
attend her, as she paced slowly down to the
road; and as he lit his cigar at his cousin’s,
he muttered angrily under his moustache—</p>

<p>“I call <i>this</i> beastly unfair. I had the old
girl all dinner time. You’ve got six to four
the best of it!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br><span class="small">A PROUD MOMENT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Captain Waring envied his comrade, who,
with Miss Gordon, sauntered on a few paces
ahead of him and, what he mentally termed,
“his old woman of the sea.” She never
ceased talking, and could not endure him
out of her sight. The others appeared to
get on capitally; they had plenty to say to
one another, and their frequent laughter
excited not alone his envy, but his
amazement.</p>

<p>Mark was not a ladies’ man; this squiring
of dames was a new departure. Such an
avocation was far more in his own line, and
by all the laws of the fitness of things, <i>he</i>
should be in Mark’s place—strolling by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
moonlight with a pretty girl along the
shores of this lovely mountain tarn. What
were they talking about? Mark never
could find much to say to girls—straining
his ears, not from the ungentlemanly wish
to listen, but merely from pure friendly
curiosity—he paid but scant attention to
Mrs. Brande’s questions, and gave her
several misleading answers.</p>

<p>“His cousin had no profession—he was
a gentleman at large—yes—his <i>protége</i>—yes.
He himself was a man of leisure—yes.”
Yes—yes—yes; he said “Yes” to
everything indiscriminately; it is so easy
to say “Yes!”</p>

<p>“It is strange that we should come
across one another twice on the same
journey,” remarked Jervis to his companion.</p>

<p>“If you had not come across me the
first time, I suppose I should be sitting in
that train still!”</p>

<p>“Oh no; not quite so long as all
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“You won’t say anything to aunt
about——”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Miss Gordon! Do you
think I look like a lunatic?”</p>

<p>“You see, I have such a dreadful way
of coming out with things, that I imagine
that what is an irresistible temptation to
<i>me</i>, might be the same to other people!”</p>

<p>“You need not be afraid, as far as I am
concerned. I can answer for myself that
I can hold my tongue. And how are you
getting on? Still counting the hours until
your departure?” with an air of gay
interrogation.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. At first I was desperately
home-sick; but I am getting over that now.”</p>

<p>And gradually she was led on to talk of
Jessie’s stories, of their celebrated mulberry
tree, and of the various quaint local characters.
Surely there was some occult
influence in the scene; or was it the frank
air and pleasant voice of this young man,
that thus unlocked her lips? She felt as if
she had known him quite a long time; at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
any rate, he was her first acquaintance in
India, and she once more repeated to herself
the comforting fact that he was also
a poor relation—that alone was a strong
bond of sympathy. As they paced the
narrow road that edged the lake of Nath
Tal, they laughed and talked with a mutual
enjoyment that filled the mind of Captain
Waring and Mrs. Brande (who were not so
happily paired) with dismay on the part of
the lady, and disgust on the side of the
gentleman. Captain Waring would no
doubt have found their conversation insipid
to the last degree; it contained no sugared
compliments, and not the smallest spice of
sentiment or flirtation.</p>

<p>“I have a bargain to propose to you two
gentlemen,” said Mrs. Brande, ere they
parted for the night. “We are going the
same marches, and to the same place; I
shall be happy to provide the commissariat,
if you will be our escort and protect us.
What do you say?” appealing to Captain
Waring with a smirk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“My dear madam, I say that we close
with your offer on the spot; it is altogether
in our favour,” was his prompt reply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande beamed still more effulgently.
There was no occasion to consult the other
young man.</p>

<p>“Then we will consider it all settled; it
is a banderbust,” and taking Honor’s arm,
she nodded quite an affectionate good night,
and retired into her own quarters.</p>

<p>Precisely at six o’clock the next day the
party made a start—the men on sturdy hill
ponies, the ladies in dandies. What can
be more exquisite than a clear April morning
on the lower slopes of the Himalayas?
The lake was still and lay half in shadow;
the dew glittered among the cherry
blossoms, as if they were set in diamonds;
the low rush-covered marshes were sprinkled
with herds of cattle, and the doves were
cooing in the dense woods that overlooked
the misty blue plains. The travellers encountered
many groups of hill folk, going to
work among the cultivated patches lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
down, or in the neighbouring tea-gardens,
as they passed through a village, a flock of
delightful little brown children sallied out
and tossed freshly plucked monthly roses
into the ladies’ laps, “so charmingly Arcadian
and simple,” thought Honor. But she
was disillusioned, by the same little brown
elves pursuing them for half a mile, with
shrill demands for “Bucksheesh! bucksheesh!”</p>

<p>As they toiled upwards, the day grew
perceptibly warmer, the ascent steeper. At
twelve o’clock they halted by a mountain
stream under some evergreen oaks, and
there found an excellent repast awaiting
them. Mrs. Brande’s portly cook had
girded up his loins, and hastened by short
cuts and by-paths, and now lay in ambush
with this welcome repast of fowl, cold pie,
rolls and coffee; claret and hock were
cooling in a neighbouring stream.</p>

<p>There was <i>some</i> satisfaction in being
escort to Mrs. Brande, who sat on a box,
presiding over the table-cloth, and looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
the embodiment of gratified hospitality.
When the meal had come to an end and
the men were smoking, she said—</p>

<p>“What’s that in your dandy, Honor? I
see you taking as much care of it as if
it was some great treasure; not your new
hats, I <i>hope</i>?” in a tone of real concern.</p>

<p>“No, aunt; it is my violin—a much more
important affair.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, child! Why did you not
leave it with the heavy baggage?”</p>

<p>“Because it might have been smashed.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it was, it could be mended.
We have a very clever Maistry carpenter
at Shirani. I often give him little jobs.
My butler—a Goanese—has a fiddle, too,
and of an evening I hear him giving the
other servants a benefit.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he and I may play duets,” remarked
Honor, demurely.</p>

<p>“My dear child!” with a deeply horrified
air. “How can you talk in such a wild
way? Captain Waring is shocked—ain’t
you, captain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Dreadfully scandalized; and I will only
condone the outrage to my feelings on one
condition, that Miss Gordon plays us a
solo. Will you, Miss Gordon? This is
the hour and the place.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brande naturally expected that her
niece would require at least a quarter of an
hour’s incessant pressing; and, indeed, in
spite of what the Hodsons had told her,
this benighted old person was not at all
sure that it was the correct thing for a
woman to play the fiddle. “Would Mrs.
Langrishe allow her girl to do it?” and
visions of her own fat black butler, squatting
outside the house in the cool of the
day playing jigs and reels to a circle of
enraptured syces and chuprassis, rose before
her mind’s eye!</p>

<p>This vision was quickly dispelled by another.
Honor longed for the sound of her
beloved violin, her present audience were
not formidable, and she was not the least
nervous. Last time she had held her fiddle
and bow it had been a dull wet afternoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
at home—a type of the worst grey, sullen,
English weather. She had played to them
in the drawing-room Schubert’s “Adieu.”
Yes, and her mother had wept. Now,
what a different scene, and different listeners!
Two men, almost strangers, prone
on the grass, lazily expectant, and, as far as
Captain Waring was concerned, condescendingly
ready to be entertained; a stout
lady sitting on a wine-case, with her napkin
on her knee, and her topee quite at the
back of her head; a distant group of scarlet-and-white
clad servants; and all around
a scene fit to encircle Orpheus himself.
Range after range of purple-blue hills,
rising out of rhododendron and oak forests,
a rival across the valley in the shape of a
cuckoo, otherwise a waiting, sympathetic
silence.</p>

<p>As the girl took the violin out of its case,
Captain Waring could see that it was in
hands that loved it; and noted, moreover,
that the said hands were beautiful—the
wrists most daintily modelled. Soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
the bow began to call forth heavenly
sounds.</p>

<p>Honor stood up, leaning carelessly against
the trunk of a tree, and seemed wholly unconscious
of her audience; her face, which
was turned towards the hills, gradually
assumed a rapt exalted expression, and her
playing was in keeping with her attitude
and her eyes. The performance was a
revelation—a mixture of great simplicity,
with a distinct note of human passion in its
strain. Surely the music was the voice of
this girl’s sweet soul!</p>

<p>The servants boldly came near to hear
this new “Miss Sahib” who drew such
marvellous strains from the “sitar.” The
very ponies pricked their ears, a rambling
hill cow halted to listen, the competitive
cuckoo was dumb.</p>

<p>The two young men gradually dropped
their cigarettes. Mrs. Brande dropped her
jaw. Why, her niece played as well as a
man at a concert! Even better, in her
opinion, for this was a tune that touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
her, and that she could understand; those
sweet wailing notes, resembling a human
voice, penetrated her opaque sensibilities,
and wafted her to the very gates of Paradise.</p>

<p>Captain Waring surveyed with unaffected
curiosity this fair young musician, with his
elbows dug into the grass, his chin resting
on his hands. He knew something about
music; the girl played with faultless taste
and absolute purity of tone. He was listening
to “linked sweetness long drawn
out” rendered with truly expressive charm.
Here was not the common or ordinary
Indian spin, but a modern Saint Cecilia!
He glanced at Mark, to see how this
unexpected transformation had affected
him; but Mark’s face was averted, and he
gave no sign, though in reality he was
enjoying a debauch of exquisite musical
thoughts.</p>

<p>Presently the spell, a weird Russian air,
died away in a long sobbing sigh, and, save
for a murmur among the servants, there
ensued quite a remarkable pause, broken at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
length by Mrs. Brande, who exclaimed as
if she had suddenly awoke—</p>

<p>“<i>Very</i> pretty indeed! And how did you
like it, Captain Waring?”</p>

<p>“Like it!” he echoed indignantly.
“My dear madam, what a feeble and
inadequate expression! Miss Gordon plays
magnificently.”</p>

<p>“Oh indeed, no,” she protested. “I
can play music that I can feel—and that
is easy, and I began to learn the violin
when I was four years old, so that my
fingers are pretty supple; but when I think
of other people’s playing, such as Sarasate,
I realize that I am nothing more than a
well-meaning amateur, and never will be
otherwise. I cannot master any excessive
technical difficulties. I have no brilliancy—still,”
with a happy little sigh, “I am
glad that you liked it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” said her aunt, nodding
her head approvingly. “And now let us
have something lively. Suppose you play
a polka?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>But the violin was already in its case.
Honor had laid it there with the air of
a mother consigning an infant to its
rest.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Gordon, what a shame!”
expostulated Mark Jervis. “I could lie on
this sunny slope, under the rhododendrons,
listening to you for <i>days</i>.”</p>

<p>“You would not find it very comfortable
in the <i>rains</i>,” remarked Mrs. Brande, with
some asperity. She did not approve of
penniless young men thus launching compliments
at her accomplished niece. “And
now we had better be getting on, if we
are to reach Binsa before dark.”</p>

<p>The next and last day of their march
the party were proceeding as usual in
pairs; Honor and Captain Waring led the
van, whilst Jervis and Mrs. Brande, who
was a heavy load, lagged behind. The
further they journeyed, the steeper grew
the precipices, the wilder the scenery, the
narrower the paths. At one place in the
woods, high above them, grazed a herd of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
so-called tame buffaloes—tame with natives,
wild with Europeans. The huge bull, with
his hairy head and enormous horns—though
he carried a bell—was tame with
no one! Hearing strange voices below,
he lifted up his hideous china-blue eyes,
stared fiercely about him, and then came
crashing downhill for some dozen yards,
but his prey—Honor and her escort—had
already passed by, and were out of
reach. He stood still in a meditative
attitude, and gave vent to an angry and
disappointed bellow.</p>

<p>After a considerable interval, another
group came into view. Mrs. Brande’s
gay jampannis and scarlet dandy rug
settled the question. In half a moment
he had blundered through the undergrowth,
and placed himself in a warlike attitude
upon the path—exactly six yards ahead of
the party. The unanimity with which
Mrs. Brande’s bearers dropped her, and
fled up trees, was only equalled by the
agility displayed by the lady herself, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
leaping out of the dandy and scrambling
down the khud! Nothing remained on
the track but the empty vehicle, the
buffalo, and Jervis.</p>

<p>He promptly jumped off his pony,
snatched up a jampanni’s pole, on the
end of which he raised the red rug, and
boldly advanced like a matador in the
arena. When the bull lowered his ponderous
head to charge, he threw the rug over
his horns with as much coolness and
dexterity as if he had merely to deal with
a stuffed animal! But this animal was
dangerously animated. Rushing furiously
forward, he tumbled blindly over the
dandy, and with a loud crash, rolled down
the khud, which, luckily for him (and Mrs.
Brande) was not of sheer descent. The
lady’s piercing screams attracted the notice
of her niece, and—of what was far more to
the purpose—the boy who was in charge
of the herd. Probably he had been fast
asleep, but he now came racing through
the brushwood, routed up the buffalo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
whose fall had undoubtedly quenched his
spirit, and drove him away, laden with the
hearty curses of the jampannis. These
valiant gentlemen had now descended to
mother earth, as brave as lions. The rug
was in ribbons, the dandy in matchwood,
but no one was injured. “What was to
be done?” inquired Captain Waring,
vainly struggling to preserve a grave countenance,
as he saw Mrs. Brande, who
presented a truly distressing spectacle,
emerging from the bushes, on her hands
and knees. The back of her dress was
split right across the shoulders, her veil
hung round her neck, and she was covered
with sand and bits of twigs.</p>

<p>Mark had hastened to her assistance,
and her niece, as she picked up her topee
and umbrella, asked anxiously “if she was
hurt?”</p>

<p>“No,” she panted, sitting down and
dusting herself with her handkerchief,
“I’m not a bit the worse.”</p>

<p>“But your dandy is in smithereens!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
said Captain Waring. “What is to be
done?”</p>

<p>“I know what <i>has</i> been done. Young
man,” solemnly addressing herself to Jervis,
“you saved my life, as sure as I sit here,
and you stand there. If you had not had
the courage to throw the rug over his head,
he would have come down the khud, and
gored me to death—I’m not a woman of
many words” (fond delusion) “but I won’t
forget it—nor will P.” In moments of
unusual excitement, or when with her
intimates, she invariably spoke of her
husband as “P.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Brande,” he replied, “you
think a great deal too much of it—it was
only a buffalo.”</p>

<p>“Only a buffalo!” she repeated. “You
little know them; in another minute I’d
have been only a corpse. They are the
most dangerous brutes you can come across,
and so cunning. Ha,” changing her voice
to another and sharper key, “Jait Sing,
you base coward! I shall cut every one’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
pay two rupees. I’ve a mind to stop your
wood tickets. What a contrast to <i>you</i>,”
she pointed her fat finger straight at Jervis.
“Lions, indeed, as all these Sings call
themselves—pretty lions—you are the
bravest young man I ever saw!”</p>

<p>“Oh come, I say, Mrs. Brande,” expostulated
Waring, playfully. “You don’t know
what <i>I</i> could do if I tried.”</p>

<p>“Well, as you did <i>not</i> try, I cannot say,”
she answered dryly.</p>

<p>“It’s not such a marvellous feat, driving
off an old buffalo——”</p>

<p>“Depends upon the humour the buffalo
is in; and I’m surprised at you belittling
your own cousin, instead of being proud of
him,” pursued the lady with considerable
heat, and entirely forgetting her intended
<i>rôle</i> with respect to this millionaire.</p>

<p>“How are you to get on, aunt?” inquired
Honor; “but of course you must go in my
dandy and I can walk.”</p>

<p>“By no means, Miss Gordon; you shall
ride my pony,” said Captain Waring. “He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
has a grand roomy old saddle and a fine
broad back, and I will hold you from
slipping off.”</p>

<p>To this arrangement Mrs. Brande (who
had now recovered her composure and her
wits) saw no objection. Quite the contrary,
it was a capital idea. As for herself, she
felt so shattered and so nervous, that she
could not allow Mr. Jervis out of her
sight.</p>

<p>They were now within seven miles of
Shirani, and oh! what interminable miles—they
seemed leagues—leagues of dreary
monotonous road, winding and twisting
round barren fawn-coloured hills, and
apparently taking them straight into the
very heart of Asia. They wound up and
down valleys, to the crest of a range,
which hid, as they fondly hoped, long-looked-for
Shirani. Alas! it but gave them
a view of yet another valley—yet another
rounded hill slope. Honor was not surprised
to hear that a lady of her aunt’s acquaintance,
on her first visit, had, after a series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
of these maddening disappointments,
collapsed on the journey, and given way to
a storm of hysterical tears. Sometimes
Honor walked—walked by preference, but
at others, she mounted the pony in
deference to her chaperon’s wishes. She
did not enjoy her ride, it consisted of a
gradual slide, slide, slide, a recover, then
slide, slide, again. She declined Captain
Waring’s eagerly tendered arm—support
was twice as irksome as walking. Would
this detestable road never, never, come to
an end?</p>

<p>Ah, there were the pine trees of Shirani at
last! In another twenty minutes, they
were among them. As the little party
debouched into the mall, Mrs. Brande
heading the procession, Honor bringing
up the rear, with Captain Waring leading
her pony, they came face to face with Mrs.
Langrishe, walking with her most stately
air, between a soldierly looking man and
a small, beautifully dressed, fair-haired
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>Yes, she could not have failed to notice
and take in the full significance of Mrs.
Brande’s <i>rentrée</i> (indeed she and her rival
had exchanged bows), and dusty, hot, and
thirsty, as that lady was, this was one of
the happiest and proudest moments of her
life!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br><span class="small">A MESSAGE FROM MISS PASKE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Although she had only caught a fleeting
vision of Mrs. Brande’s niece, Mrs. Langrishe
had sharp eyes, and one glance had
been sufficient to assure her that the girl
was not the least like what she had expected.
She was slim and dark, and,
though covered with dust, and wearing a
frightful one rupee topee, undeniably a lady,
and not at all of the dairymaid type.</p>

<p>And how exultant the old woman had
looked! Literally puffed out with pride, as
she was carried past, with the millionaire in
close attendance. Not that <i>that</i> detail was
of the slightest consequence. Lalla knew
him intimately, and she would get her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
write him a nice, friendly little note, and
ask him to drop in to tea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Honor had been presented to
her uncle, who, far from being disappointed,
was agreeably surprised to find that she
was the image of his favourite sister Hester,
who had died when she was eighteen. This
resemblance (which he kept to himself) ensured
the new arrival an immediate <i>entrée</i>
to her uncle’s good graces. And Mrs.
Brande, accustomed to his cool and rather
cynical manner, was amazed at the warmth
of the reception he accorded to his hitherto
unknown niece.</p>

<p>For several days the young lady was kept
at home in strict seclusion, until her complexion
had recovered the journey and her
boxes had arrived from the railway. Her
aunt was determined not to submit her
treasure to the fierce gaze which beats
upon a newly arrived girl, until she was
altogether at her best. She, however, could
not close her doors to numerous ladies who
came to call upon Miss Gordon, and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
secure an early and private view. Honor
was compelled to sit in state in a hideous
drawing-room, where every colour was
shouting at another, and listen to her aunt
telling visitors how beautifully she played
the fiddle, and what long hair she had, and
how she took threes in shoes, and how
useful she was in the house already. Also,
she did not spare them full particulars of
the buffalo adventure, nor fail to sing loud
praises of Mr. Jervis, or to enlarge on his
cousin’s agreeable escort and particular attentions
<i>en route</i>. Then Mrs. Brande discussed
her servants and the outrageous
price of ghee and charcoal.</p>

<p>“Come, let us sit in the verandah,”
whispered Mrs. Sladen, who had read the
girl’s expressive face. “You will get quite
used to it,” she continued, when they were
outside; “you will do it yourself some day.
We all do; but you will have a very happy
home here, in spite of the price of potatoes!
Your aunt is delighted with you, as you
may see, and you will soon have plenty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
topics to discuss. She has been lonely
enough till now. She and Mr. Brande,
although much attached to one another,
have few tastes in common. He is fond
of literature, and devoted to tennis and
rackets; and although he is older, he is so
active that he seems years her junior. Your
coming has given her a fresh start and new
pleasures. She is a dear, good woman, and
as single-hearted as a little child.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sladen and Honor had taken to one
another at once. Honor had been down
(after dusk) to Mrs. Sladen’s house—been
presented to Colonel Sladen, and shown
the photographs of Mrs. Sladen’s little girls—Charlotte
and Mabel, and had heard their
last letters—a proof that she was in high
favour with their mother. Honor was not
accustomed to sitting with her hands before
her, and promptly found occupation in
various ways—she ran messages, wrote
notes and orders, arranged flowers, and
ventured on respectful suggestions with
regard to the drawing-room, a fine apartment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
expensively furnished in the worst
taste imaginable—a supreme contrast to
Mrs. Langrishe’s room, which was the
prettiest in Shirani. People little suspected
how that leisurely lady dusted it entirely
herself, shook out draperies, arranged
flowers, and washed the china ornaments
with her own delicate hands. Her room,
as she understood it, made an effective
background for herself—and she spared no
pains to frame Ida Langrishe in the most
becoming fashion. The floor was covered
with fine old prayer-rugs, the tables were
strewn with curios, the walls hung with
valuable water colours, and scattered at
suitable intervals were inviting armchairs.</p>

<p>Ill-natured people assured one another
that the Persian rugs, carvings, and silver
bowls were all so many offerings from
“men.” Even so Mrs. Langrishe would
have been the first to admit, “Presents to
Granby and myself. Colonel Greene, a
dear old thing, brought us the carpet from
Peshawar; and Mr. Goldhoofe sent those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
silver things from Delhi. I must say that
our friends never forget us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Langrishe, as we know, had fully
determined to hand over the drawing-room
to her niece, it would be such good practice
for the child, and really the flowers took
up an hour every morning. She would
find many ways of making Lalla useful.
But that young lady steadily objected to
these plans, she immediately made her
aunt aware that she considered herself
merely ornamental. “Oh dear no! she
never arranged flowers, she had no taste
in that line, and besides, it would spoil
her hands. <i>Dust</i> the drawing-room!
dear Aunt Ida must be joking; why, that
was the bearer’s business. Get out the
dessert! oh!” with a peal of ringing
laughter, “she was not to be trusted.
She would eat every chocolate, and all the
best French sweets!”</p>

<p>So whilst Mrs. Langrishe laboured, as
usual, over her household tasks, her fair
niece, with a locked door, lay upon her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
bed, reading a novel, tried new experiments
in the hairdressing line, or wrote
notes. No, no; she had not come to
Shirani to be a lady-help. She had always
heard that her aunt Ida was very <i>clever</i>;
but, luckily, she had her wits about her
also!</p>

<p>During Honor Gordon’s period of enforced
retirement, she went early every
morning for a solitary walk along a pretty
sandy road, that wound among the dark
aromatic pine woods—a road with sharp
angles, and deep leafy ravines, green with
ferns and ivy. It was early in May, and
the ground was strewn with pine-needles,
which deadened the footfall; the firs were
thin and bare, and through their dark
branches she caught glimpses of the
snows, that like a great white rampart
hung in mid-air, between a brilliant blue
sky and an opal-tinted mist. Honor
enjoyed these rambles immensely, though
she rarely met a soul, save a syce exercising
a horse, or an ayah wheeling a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
perambulator. Her sole companion was
“Ben,” who luckily had “taken to her,”
and with whom she had established relations
of such a friendly character, that
she had actually been installed in the
unexpected position of his “aunt.”</p>

<p>Occasionally they made joint excursions
down the khud, he in search of the private
larders of other dogs, she in quest of ferns
and moss for table decoration. Ben was
a personage of such importance at Rookwood
that he demands half a chapter to
himself. He was a dog with fixed opinions,
and hated Mrs. Langrishe—and one or two
other people—in the same degree that he
hated cold boiled meat. Sport was his
passion, the chewing up of Suède gloves
his weakness. He was a fox-terrier with
a history. As a pup, he had been presented
by a man to a girl, on the principle of
“love me love my dog,” but alas, the false
maiden had loved neither the one nor the
other; she heartlessly jilted the man, and
abandoned the dog to his fate. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
her ayah (prudent soul) ere she went down
the hill, sold the pup to a bheestie for the
sum of two annas (an ancient debt), he
happened to be Mrs. Brande’s servant,
and was excessively vain of his purchase,
but left him most of the day tied by a strip
of pink calico to a conspicuous tree in her
compound, where he suffered him to “eat
the air,” and but little else. Mrs. Brande,
<i>en route</i> to feed her well-to-do fowls, noticed
the famishing animal; and as she often
threw him a crust, he naturally hailed her
advent with extravagant demonstrations
of delight and feeble yelps of joy. Her
easily softened heart was touched by the
raptures of the starving puppy, and after
some parley she bought him from the
bheestie for the sum he swore he had paid—to
wit, ten rupees—in order to feed him
up and get him a good master. But Ben
was thoroughly satisfied with his present
quarters, and soon made himself completely
at home. He displayed an easy intimacy
with armchairs and cushions, he had undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
been accustomed to sweet biscuits
and to good society, and his mistress pointed
out with just pride that he understood
English perfectly! Of course she eventually
adopted “Ben,” he made himself
indispensable, he refused to be separated
from his patroness, and became her shadow,
and soon ceased to be a shadow himself.
He grew from a dirty, starving, shivering
whelp, into an extremely handsome dog,
with a fine gloss on his coat. Did he ever
remember his own evil days, as he lounged
of an afternoon sunning himself at the gate
of Rookwood, and passed in scornful review,
curs less happy and of low degree? Are
dogs snobs?</p>

<p>Whether snob or not, Ben was brave,
he lowered his tail to none, and when the
big wild cat that created such havoc among
the poultry, went to ground under the
messhouse, “Ben Brande,” as he was called,
was the only one of the assembled mob of
terriers, who, as a looker on expressed it,
“was man enough to follow him, kill him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
and drag him out.” Ben Brande lost an
eye thereby, but gained a magnificent
reputation.</p>

<p>Of course Ben was spoiled. His mistress
talked to him incessantly; he had his own
little charpoy in her room, his morning
tea in her company, and now and then he
was permitted to invite his pal “Jacko,”
a red terrier, to dine and spend the day!
(Once they had elected to spend it quietly
in Mr. Brande’s dressing-room, where they
devoured several pairs of boots, a sponge-bag,
and the back of “Nancy.”) Ben
escorted his mistress in her walks and
drives. Many a time she went out solely
on his account, and it was an indisputable
fact that he had favourite roads, and
his “grandmamma”—as the infatuated
lady called herself—always studied his
wishes. On those occasions when “his
grandpapa and grandmamma” were dining
abroad, he never went to bed, but established
himself at the entrance until
their return (however late), and passers-by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
could always tell that the Brandes were
at a “burra khana” when they saw an
upright little white figure sitting by the
gatepost. Indeed it was whispered, that
the reason Mrs. Brande was always so
early to depart, was simply that she did
not like to keep Ben waiting up! She
never said so, but every one knew that
Ben was the real motive for her premature
departure. And this was the animal who
now accompanied Honor, and who had
accorded her his patronage and friendship.
One morning, as they were strolling homewards,
he with a large stone in his mouth,
and she carrying an armful of ferns, they
nearly came into collision with another
couple—the angles were abrupt—walking
noiselessly on pine needles. They proved
to be Toby Joy, who was also attended by
a dog, and sauntering along hand-in-hand
with a young lady, a dainty, white-skinned
little person, with fluffy light hair, small
keen eyes, admirably arched brows and a
tip-tilted nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>Honor was by far the most embarrassed
of the trio, and blushed a good healthy
blush—of which she was heartily ashamed.
Why should not other people enjoy the
delicious morning air? As to walking
hand-in-hand, <i>she</i> ought to be the last
person to object; had she not walked hand-in-hand
herself with an absolute stranger?</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Gordon,” said
Toby, slowly relinquishing Miss Paske’s
fingers, and doffing his cap. “So you have
got up here all right in spite of the buffalo!
Let me introduce you to Miss Paske.”</p>

<p>The girls bowed, and looked at one another
gravely.</p>

<p>“We are getting up that burlesque I told
you about, and have come out early to
study our part together.”</p>

<p>“How praiseworthy of you,” said Honor,
in simple good faith. “And what is the
piece to be?”</p>

<p>“<i>The Babes in the Wood</i>,” responded
Miss Paske with an odd smile, and looking
Honor over with her bright little eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
“Don’t you think it will be suitable to the
dear simple people at Shirani?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” replied the other,
with a puzzled face.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you will come to see it,”
and with a patronizing nod she moved on.
But Ben and Jumbo (Mrs. Langrishe’s dog)
were not disposed to part thus! The household
feud had evidently extended to them.
They had been tiptoeing round one another
for some time, with considerable stiffness in
their gait, emitting low and insulting growls,
that now culminated in a sort of gurgling
snarl, as they flew at one another’s throats.
Miss Paske gave a little stifled shriek, and
scrambled hastily up the bank, whilst Honor
and Toby made desperate attempts to separate
the combatants. They each caught
hold of a dog by whatever came first, leg
or tail; but the dogs refused to be parted,
and to and fro, and up and down, they
struggled and scrambled in a mutual frenzy.
Meanwhile, Lalla, who was now at a safe
elevation, actually appeared delighted at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
the performance, and laughed and clapped
her hands ecstatically. At last, by the
expedient of pouring sand on their heads,
the dogs were choked off, and each side
was bottle-holder to a furious, panting,
struggling animal.</p>

<p>“I think we had better separate at once,”
gasped Honor, who only restrained Ben
with the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>“Yes, the sooner the better,” agreed
Toby, who was also wrestling with an eager
armful.</p>

<p>As Honor turned homewards, with Ben
hanging longingly over her shoulder, Miss
Paske, who had tripped down from her
coign of ’vantage, called after her, in her
sweetest, clearest tones—</p>

<p>“Be sure you tell Mrs. Brande, that <i>her</i>
dog got the worst of it.”</p>
